            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Learned and Reverend Judge, the Author of the Reports following, as he was highly honoured for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge in the Lawes of this Nation; and upon that account choſen one of the Queens Serjeants at Law, by that Wiſe Princeſſe, Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and not long after for his fidelity in that Service, preferred by her to be one of the Judges of the Court of <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> So he had the happineſs to have his Name and Memory perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thoſe Excellent Parts and Abilities of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht Gentleman, Sir <hi>Roger Owen,</hi> his Son and Heire, an Eminent Patriot of his Countrey, who performed the office of a pious and dutifull Son, in Erecting a Monument to the Memory of his worthy Father, in the Abby-Church at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> where you may ſee a ſhort Hiſtory of this Reverend Perſon.

The Work it ſelf is a Miſcellany and Collection of choice and ſelect Caſes in the Law, and beſpeaks thy acceptance and entertainment, not onely from the variety of the Subject and matter, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is ſo comprehenſive, that there is ſcarce any doubt or queſtion in the Law can be raiſed, but it gives light towards the deciſion and reſolution of it: but from the Authority of the Authors ſage Wiſdome and Prudence, which, like a pretious Limbeck, derives unto thee the Spirit and Quinteſſence of thoſe many learned Arguments that were made in theſe Caſes, both at the Bar and Bench. If in naturall Births and Productions it gives value and eſteem to the Iſſue to be deſcended from wiſe and noble Parents, upon that common preſumption, that <hi>Robora Parentum filii referunt.</hi> The conſideration ſhould much more take place in the Reſults and Emanations of the mind and braine, wherein thoſe Tendeys and Traditions muſt neceſſarily be conceived to have the greateſt authority, which are moſt heightned with Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Such are the Reports of this Reverend, Judge, from which I ſhall no longer detain Thee.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>EONARD</hi> chief Prothonotary, brought an Action of Treſpaſſe againſt <hi>Stephens;</hi> who juſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heyden</hi> Knight, was ſeiſed in Fee, and enfeoffed the Defendant, and gave colour to the Plaintiff; The Plaintiff replied, that true it was that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> was ſo ſeiſed, but he being ſo ſeiſed, died ſeiſed of the Premiſſes, and that after his death, they did diſcend to his Son and Heire, who entred and was ſeiſed, and being ſo ſeiſed did enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off the Plaintiff: Without that, that the ſaid Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> did enfeoff the Defendant, whereupon Iſſue was joyned, and the Iury gave an eſpeciall Verdict to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Chriſtopher Heyden <hi>was ſeiſed as aforeſaid, and made a Leaſe for years to the Defendant by Deed, containing theſe words, <hi>Dedi &amp; conceſſi &amp; confirmavi</hi> to the Defendant and his Heires, with a Letter of Attorney to make Livery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, whether this was a Feoffment, or but a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>Walmſley</hi> Serjeant, It is but Confirmation being by Deed, and hath the word <hi>Confirmation. Anderſon,</hi> By that reaſon he in the Reverſion cannot enfeoff his Leſſee for years by Deed as he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deed: but I conceive, that it is at the liberty and choice of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57352:8"/>Leſſee either to take it as a Feoffment or a Confirmation. <hi>Walmſley,</hi> As ſoon as the Leſſee hath accepted the Deed, by that he hath declared his meaning to have it as a Confirmation.
<hi>Anderſon,</hi> And when the Leſſee doth accept the Livery, doth not that ſhew his expreſſe meaning to take it by the Livery, and ſhall the Livery ſignifie nothing?</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Bracebridges</hi> Caſe, where the Tenant in tail made a Bargain and Sale, and made Livery, and the Deed was inrolled within the ſix months: this was adjudged to be a Diſcontinuance, and yet the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and Sale makes no diſcontinuance, which little differs from the caſe in queſtion. <hi>Walmſley,</hi> If Tenant in tail be diſſeiſed, and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between the Diſſeiſor and the Diſſeiſee, that the Diſſeiſee ſhall make a Deed to the Diſſeiſor, who makes a Deed accordingly, it is not in the election of the Diſſeiſor to take this as a Feoffment. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> The Caſes differed, for the Diſſeiſee hath no power to make a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And adjudged by the Court that it was a good Feoffment, <hi>vide 17 Aſſ. 20.22 H. 6.43.</hi>

<hi>21 H. 8.</hi> became void, and after the ſaid Incumbent died, and divers others were preſented by the Patrons, who died alſo, whereby the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes void againe. If the Queen may now take her turn to preſent, in regard ſhe took not her turn when the firſt <hi>Lapſe</hi> happened immediatly at the firſt avoidance, was the queſtion. And after long and ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, all the Iuſtices of the Common Pleas did reſolve.</p>
               <p>That the Queen ſhal not now have her Preſentment, but the Patron, becauſe the Queen hath ſuch preſentment by <hi>Lapſe</hi> as the Biſhop had, and no other, and could preſent but to the preſent avoidance then void: and although <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> yet we muſt diſtinguiſh it thus, for where the King is limited to a time certaine, or to that which in its ſelf is tranſitory, there the King muſt do it within the time limited, or in that time wherin the thing to be done hath eſſence or conſiſtence, or while it remaineth, for otherwiſe he ſhall never do it. For if the Grantee of the next avoidance, or Leſſee
<hi>Per auter vie</hi> be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint,<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57352:8"/>here the King muſt take his intereſt and advantage during the time, <hi>viz.</hi> during the life of
<hi>Ceſtui que vie,</hi> or within the years of the next avoidance, or otherwiſe he ſhall never have it: the ſame Law is where a ſecond preſentment is granted to the King, and he does not preſent, he ſhall not preſent after. <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> we have an Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the Plaintiff, whereupon Iudgment was ſtaied: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hil. 29 Eliz.</hi> The Queens Serjeants ſhewing that the Plaintiff was outlawed; It was argued by <hi>Walmſley,</hi> that that could not now come into debate, for the plaintiff hath no bay in Court after judgment, and it is but a ſurmiſe that the plaintiff is the ſame party. <hi>Windham,</hi> In a debt upon an Obligation, the Serjeants may pray the debt for the Queen, and yet it is but a ſurmiſe.</p>
               <p>And the opinion of three Iuſtices was (for <hi>Anderſon</hi> was abſent) that the Writ to the Biſhop ought to be ſtaied; but in what manner proceſſe ſhould be made if the <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue againſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, they ſaid, they would adviſe concerning the Courſe: But <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid, that a <hi>Scire facias</hi> might have iſſued againſt the ancient Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, and then the Queen ſhall bring a <hi>Scire facias</hi> again, becauſe ſhe had no preſentation. And the <hi>Scire facias</hi> was brought againſt <hi>Beverly. Walmſley,</hi> I conceive the Queen ſhall have no Preſentation, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have acknowledged our Preſentment, yet before execution we have but a right; As if a Diſſeiſee be outlawed he ſhall not forfeit the profits of his Land; alſo he hath brought a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and a <hi>Scire facias</hi> lies not but by him that is party or privy. <hi>Periam,</hi> After that we have this Chattell, it is forfeit by Outlawry. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> The Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he ſhall recover, ſhall not remove the Incumbent, and then the Plaintiff hath but a right; to which <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Walmſley</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed: but as to the other point, that the Queen ſhall not have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> for default of privity, they ſaw no reaſon, for in many Caſes ſhe ſhall have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Record between ſtrangers:
<hi>Anderſon,</hi> If I recover in debt and then I am outlawed, ſhall the Queen have this debt? <hi>Walmſley,</hi> If I recover in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and dye, who ſhall have the Preſentment my Executor or my Heire? To which no anſwer was made: But the Court would take advice for the rareneſſe of the Caſe.

                  <hi>RIchmond</hi> brought an Action of Debt againſt <hi>Butcher,</hi> the caſe was; A man makes a Leaſe for years, reſerving Rent to him and his Executors and Aſſignes, and during the terme the Leſſor dies, and his Heire, who hath the Reverſion, brings an Action of Debt. And it was urged, that the Rent was incident to the Reverſion, and the Heire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reverſion ſhall have the Rent alſo as incident to it, as the caſe is in the <hi>27 H. 8.16.</hi> If <hi>H.</hi> makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying any more words, the Heire ſhall have this part, becauſe it ſhall go along with the Reverſion: So in the fifth of <hi>Edw. 4.4.</hi> If two Ioynt-tenants make a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent to one of them, yet the other ſhall have the Rent alſo, although no mention were made of him; ſo in the <hi>7 H. 4.223.</hi> By the Court, If I make a Feoffment in Fee, rendring a Rent to me, my Heires may diſtraine: And if I grant over this Rent, my Aſſignees in this caſe may diſtraine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow: ſo in this caſe an Action will lye for the Heire, although he be not mentioned. But adjudged to the contrary by the Court; for when <hi>H.</hi> paſſeth Lands from himſelf, the Law gives him liverty to paſſe them in ſuch way and manner as he himſelf will, and this liberty ought to take effect according to the expreſſe words, for the Law will not extend the words further, for the intent ſhall appeare by the words, and then it cannot be here intended that his will was that his Heire ſhall have the Rent, becauſe the words are not ſufficient to give it to his Heirs: And therefore note a diverſity when the Law makes a Tenure, and when the party; for if the Law makes a Tenure, the Heirs ſhall have the Rent: but otherwiſe where the party makes it, unleſſe there be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words for the Heire, as in <hi>10 Edw.
4.19.</hi> by <hi>Moile,</hi> If <hi>H.</hi> makes a Gift in <hi>T.</hi> and reſerves no Rent: yet ſhall the Donee hold of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and his Heires, as the Denor holds over; but if he make a Leaſe for yeares, rendring Rent to the Leſſor, the Heire ſhall not have this Rent, for it is a Tenure made by the act of the party. So in the Book of <hi>Aſſiſes 86.</hi> If a man lets two acres of Land, rendring Rent ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for one of them to himſelf by name, without naming his Heires, it is adjudged that the Heire ſhall not have the Rent of this acre. And this is reſembled to the caſe of <hi>12 Edw. 2.</hi> Where a man made a Leaſe for yeares, rendring Rent to the Leſſor and his Aſſignes, here none ſhal have the Rent but the Leſſor, and it is void by his death, for his Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee cannot be privy to the Reſervation; and the words of the party ſhall not in any caſe be enlarged, unleſſe there be great inconvenience to be avoided: and his intent and will is performed if he himſelf have the Rent. And if a man reſerve ſuch Rent to him and his Executors, this word Executors is to no purpoſe, for that the Rent cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to them, but the Rent ſhall be extinct by his death: And if he reſerve the Rent to his Heire, and not to himſelf he ſhall not have it, but his Heire, for he ſhall be eſtopped to claime it, againſt his own words and reſervation. And if I make a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent to me during the terme, if I dye without Heire during the terme, the Lord by Eſcheat ſhall not have the Rent: which caſe may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the caſe of Warranty, <hi>6 H.
7.2.</hi> That without mention of the<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57352:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heires, the Warranty ſhall not bind them: But if a Rent be reſerved to his Aſſignes, and he grants over the Reverſion, here becauſe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes were mentioned in the Reſervation, and for that now there is a privity, the Aſſignees ſhall have the Rent, for it ſhall be intended that when he ſpeaks of Aſſignes in the Reſervation, he prefixeth thereby to whom he will. Aſſigne the Reſervation, wherefore it was adjudged for the Defendant, <hi>vide Dyer 2 Eliz. 180, 181. H.</hi> bargaines and ſells Land: <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if the Vendor ſhall pay a hundred pounds to the Vendes his Heires or Aſſignes, that then the Bargaine and Sale ſhall be void: by two Iuſtices.</p>
               <p>The Tendor ſhall not be made to the Executors, becauſe the Law will determine to whom the Tendor ſhall be made, when the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are expreſly agreed.</p>

The Leſſee commits Waſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo dictum Meſſuagium cadere,</hi> and the grantee of the Reverſion brought an action of Waſt. The Errors aſſigned were,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That he brought but one action of Waſt, although of ſeverall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by ſeverall Leſſors, wheras he ought to have two actions of Waſt. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> He cannot have an Action in other manner then his Grantor might have before the Grant, and when the reverſion came to him, it can be in other plight then it was before. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> There is a diverſity when the right is ſeverall, and when the poſſeſſion is ſeverall; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the poſſeſſion be ſeverall, yet if the right be intire, but one action will lys, as appeares
<hi>F.N.B. fol. 2. Godfrey,</hi> There is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Writ of Right in <hi>F.N.B.</hi> and this action, for there he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intituled but onely to the action, but in our caſe the action was once ſeverall, and is like the caſe in <hi>F.N.B. 60.</hi> where it is ſaid, that a man may have one action of Waſt, and declare upon divers Leaſes, but that is intended where the Leaſes are made by one perſon, and he cited the caſe in <hi>21 H.
7.39.</hi> where it is agreed by all the Iuſtices, that if a man hold two acres of one <hi>H.</hi> by ſeverall Services, and dies without Heire, the Lord ſhall not have one Writ of Eſcheat, but ought to have two Writs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham</hi> chief Iuſtice did agree with <hi>Gawdy,</hi> for although that at firſt the Leſſors were intituled to ſeverall Actions, yet by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> the Actions may be united: and ſaid, that <hi>H.</hi> might have an action of Waſte, and declare <hi>ex aſſignatione,</hi> and alſo <hi>ex dimiſſione.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Error was aſſigned, that he had aſſigned the Waſte to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the whole houſe, whereas he had but part of the houſe, and Waſte may be brought for part of a houſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Error was, becauſe the other Coparcener was not joyned with him in the Action.

                  <hi>The Abbot of</hi> Kingſwold <hi>in</hi> Wiltſhire,
<hi>being ſeiſed of Land in the 28th yeare of</hi> H. <hi>8. did (with conſent of the Covent) make a Leaſe for years by Deed indented, and then the Abby came into the hands of</hi> H. <hi>8. and from him to</hi> Edw. <hi>6 and from him to the preſent Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was pleaded that the Defendant hath the Leaſe, and that
<hi>Henry Thinne</hi> did intrude on the Defendant, and made a Leaſe to the Plaintiff, who being ejected by the Defendant brought this Action, and on this matter the parties demurred.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> It was ſaid that the Plaintiff cannot bring this Action, inaſmuch as <hi>Henry Thinne</hi> by his entry on Leſſee for years, the Reverſion being in the Queen cannot gaine any poſſeſſion, ſo that nothing paſſeth by his Leaſe to the Plaintiff. But the Court was againſt this, for he is a ſufficient Leſſee to maintain an Action of Ejectment: And it was adjudged in the Exchequer Chamber, that the Queens Leſſee for years being outed may have an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> which proves that he is put out of poſſeſſion of his terme, and this very point was in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed the laſt terme, in the caſe of

               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy,</hi> That is no difference, for the Leſſee for years of an Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhall maintain at <hi>Ejectione firmae:</hi> And I have ſeen a Report <hi>34 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Badinton</hi> and <hi>Hawle</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> adjudged, that if the Queens Copyholder be outed, and a Leaſe be made for years by the Intrudor, this Leſſee ſhall not have an Ejectment if he be outed, but he ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſſe againſt any ſtranger.</p>
               <p>The ſecond exception was taken to the pleading, becauſe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleaded in <hi>que eſtate del Leſſee del Abbe,</hi> without ſhewing how he came to the Eſtate. And by the Court a good exception, for he ſhall be compelled to ſhew how he came to an Eſtate in the terme, inaſmuch as it cannot be by loyall means, <hi>vide 1. &amp; 2 Eliz. Dyer
171.</hi> that a <hi>Que Eſtate</hi> of a particular Eſtate of a terme is not good, and <hi>7 Eliz. Dyer 238.</hi> where the Plea was of a <hi>que Eſtate</hi> of a Termor, and exception taken to it; and the difference between it and a Freehold, ſo in the <hi>7 H. 6.440.</hi> it was agreed that

               <p>The third exception was, that the Defendant pleaded a Leaſe made by the Abbot and Covent by Indenture as it ought to be, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hic in curia prolat.</hi> which exception was alſo clearly allowed by the Court, for he is privy to it, and therefore he ought to ſhew it. And for theſe two exceptions, but eſpecially for the former. Iudgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Plaintiff.</p>

Iudgment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Plaintiff replied, that they did re-enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, without that, that he did enfeoff a ſtranger <hi>modo &amp; forma.</hi> The Iury found, that there was a Fine of twenty acres, and that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff being Diſſeiſor of all, made a Feoffment of ſix of the acres to a ſtranger. <hi>Et ſi ſupra totam materiam, &amp;c.</hi> And it was objected that the Record was intire, and the Error is a <hi>Choſe in Action,</hi> and not a <hi>Choſe in Droit,</hi> and therefore cannot be divided, but if it were a <hi>Choſe in Droit,</hi> it is otherwiſe, as if a Diſſeiſee of twenty acres releaſeth all his right in five acres, this doth extinguiſh all his right in the five a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres: ſo upon a Feoffment of parcell, yet the right remaineth as to the remnant: But of a <hi>Choſe in Action</hi> which is meerly entire, no apportionment can be, as in the <hi>31 Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, between <hi>Charnock</hi> and
<hi>Wrotheſley,</hi> the caſe was; <hi>Husband and Wife levied a Fine of the Wives Land, and after becauſe the Wife was within age, they ſued a Writ of Error to reverſe the Fine.</hi> The queſtion was, If this ſhould be reverſed as to the Wiſe onely, or againſt the Husband accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of <hi>Belknap</hi> in the <hi>50 Ed. 3.</hi> And after long debate it was reſolved that it ſhould be againſt both, for it is intire, and cannot be affirmed in part and diſaffirmed in another part. And the Lord
<hi>Norris</hi> caſe is very agreeable to this, where Tenant for life did levy an erroneous Fine, and then was attaint by Parliament, and all the right which he had to any Land was given to the Queen; and it was adjudged that there is no title of Error, nor was it given to the Queen by this word, Right, and then if it be ſo, the Title of Error is not of any right in the land, but onely to the Suit, and if it be a Suit, it is a Suit intire, for he cannot have ſeverall Suits, as is agreed in Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Knightleys</hi> caſe. A man had judgment to recover <hi>150 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> and did releaſe
<hi>20 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> of it, and after ſued execution, and the other brought an <hi>Audita querela</hi> upon the Releaſes, and defeated all the execution. But it is otherwiſe where ſuch apportionment of ſuch Suit is done by act in Law, as in <hi>7 Ed. 4. fol. ultimo.</hi> The Sheriff levied parcell of the debt by <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> yet ſhall he have an Action of Debt for the Reſidue upon the Record: But in this caſe it is the act of the party himſelf that deſtroies his Suit for part of the Land, for which it ſhall deſtroy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuit, for the Error is intire as to all the land and cannot be divided, as in the <hi>38 Ed. 3.</hi> and <hi>12 H 6.</hi> if a falſe Verdict be found, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty greived does make a Feoffment of parcell he ſhall not have an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint for any part: So in the <hi>19 H.
6.</hi> and the <hi>39 Aſſ.</hi> If he who hath cauſe to bring a Writ of Error or Attaint, does take a Leaſe for years of parcell, he doth ſuſpend his Action, and if he takes in fee, it is quite gone,. But it was reſolved by the Court that the Feoffment does not deſtroy the Title of the Writ of Dower, for more then ſo much as a Feoffment was made of; and thereupon they firſt took a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57352:18"/>ſuſpenſion and extinguiſhment of an Action, for peradventure if he ſuſpend his Action as to any part for any time, this is a ſuſpenſion unto all, but extinguiſhment of part; is a Bar to that part onely; and <hi>Gawdy</hi> cited the caſe in <hi>9 H. 6.</hi> where Iudgment was reverſt for part only, and it is not unuſuall to have a Fine reverſed for part: as if a fine be levied of lands in ancient Demeſne, <hi>47 Ed. 3.9. a.</hi> there by
<hi>Parſley,</hi> If there be Error in Law as to one parcell, and Error in Fact as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other parcell, the Iudgment as touching the matter of Law may be reverſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner;</hi> He who hath Title to reverſe a Fine, or recovery by Writ of Error, hath right in the Land, and if he releaſe all his right in the land, the Error is extinct, and the reaſon of the Lord
<hi>Norris</hi> Caſe was not that the Title to the Error was an Action in privity annexed to the party to the Record and his Heires, and cannot be transferred over to another, no more then a Writ of partition between Coparceners, or a <hi>Nuper obiit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham,</hi> He who hath Title to have the Writ of Error hath no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Land, although that thereby he be to be reſtored to the Lande for if the Land diſcend to one who hath Title to have the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, without doubt it ſhall not be accounted a remitter: But as to the matter now in queſtion, he ſaid, that if two men bring a Writ of Error in the Realty, and the Tenant plead the releaſe of one, this is a good Bar againſt both, becauſe the Error in the Record is releaſed: But if one who hath Title to a Writ of Error, does make a Releaſe of all his Right in one acre, this is a Bar but for ſo much, inaſmuch as the Releaſe is a Bar but as to the Reſtitution of the Land onely, and no Releaſe of Errors in the Record, for by the Reverſall of a Fine or Recovery, the party may annihilate the Record, and have Reſtitution of that which the Record before took from him, and therefore it ſhall bar the Plaintiff. And the opinion of all the Court was, that the Fine ſhould be reverſed for that part of the Land onely, whereof no Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made, but for ſome defects in the Writ of Error, Iudgment was ſtayed.</p>

4 15.</hi> but this difference was taken by the Court. In an Action of Debt upon a Bond, Vtlary of the Plaintiff is a Plea in Bar, and the reaſon is, becauſe all the Debts in ſpecialties are forfeited to the Queen by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Outlawry, and becauſe the Queen is to have them, it is a good Plea in Bar: But in a Treſpaſſe or Debt upon a Contract, the Outlawry is but to the abatement of the Writ, and the Queen ſhall not have Debts upon ſimple Contracts, but after the Outlawry pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Plaintiff may have an Action for them again.

<hi>Stephen</hi> entred and outed the Termor, and infeoffed <hi>John Leveſon</hi> and his Heires, and then the Termor re-enters, claiming his Terme, and for Rent arreare the Defendant made Counſans as aforeſaid, and it was adjudged againſt the Defendant, becauſe this entry and Feoffment by
<hi>Noke</hi> to <hi>Leveſon,</hi> and the re-entry of the Termor is no Attornment, and this varies from <hi>Littleberries</hi> caſe, where the Leſſor entred and made a Feoffment, and the Leſſee re-entred, for

               <p>
                  <hi>Dyer,</hi> It is no good Frank-marriage, becauſe the uſuall words are not obſerved, and if the word <hi>Liberum</hi> be omitted, it is not Frank-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, neither is it good given to a man, but it muſt be to a woman, for a man cannot give land to a woman <hi>Cauſa matrimonii praelocuti:</hi> And in this caſe the party ought to be of the blood of the Donor, who by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility may be inheritable to him, and there ought to be a Tenure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and an acquittall, and if any faile, it is no Frank-marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and he ſaid further, that if it once takes effect as Frank-marriage, and then the Donor grants the Reverſion, or the Reverſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the Donees, yet it ſhall not be deſtroyed, but ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as an Eſtate in taile, and not for life, becauſe it once took effect in the Donees and their iſſues, and if land be given to a man in Frank-marriage, the remainder in taile, yet this ſhall not deſtroy the Frank-marriage, and the Donee ſhall hold of the Donor, and not of him in the remainder: And if one give land in Frank-marriage, the remainders to the Donees in taile, yet is this a good Frank-marriage, and if the Donor grants over his Services, yet doth the Frank-marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age continue, although the Donees attorn, for they are incident to the Reverſion, and therefore the Grant is void, but if the Reverſion be granted the Services will paſſe, and he concluded that the Husband had all, and the Wife nothing, becauſe no Eſtate to her is mentioned in the Premiſſes, and he could not conſtrue the words to be the intent of the Donor, for here is an expreſſe limitation of the fee to the Husband<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57352:20"/>and his Heirs, which cannot be controlled by intendment. And after <hi>25 Eliz.</hi> It was adjudged to be no Frank-marriage, nor gift in taile, but a Fee-ſimple: And the Iuſtices ſaid, that the ancient Books were that where it took not effect as a Frank-marriage, it ſhould be in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall taile, yet thoſe at this time are not Law: But they agreed, that this at one time took effect as Frank-marriage, and by matter <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> may be made an Eſtate in taile.</p>

               <p>IT was moved in this Caſe, that if Tenant for terme <hi>Dauter vie,</hi> does continue and hold in his Eſtate, after the death of

               <p>
                  <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> He was legally in at firſt, and therefore cannot be a Diſſeiſor, <hi>15 Ed. 4.41.</hi> A Freehold could not be gained where he came in by the agreement of the party, and <hi>12 Aſſ. 22.</hi> Where the Husband and Wife were ſeiſed of a Freehold, and after were divorced by Suit, on the womans part, whereby the woman is to have all the land, yet if the Husband continue poſſeſſion and dies ſeiſed, this diſcent ſhall not take away entry, becauſe he was no Diſſeiſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy,</hi> He is Tenant at ſufferance and no Diſſeiſor, and there it was moved, that if Tenant at ſufferance, or a Diſſeiſor makes Copies of Copyhold Lands, if they be good or voidable: And note that <hi>Wilde</hi> took here a diverſity between a Termor that holds over, and a Tenant at ſufferance; for in caſe of a Tenant at ſufferance, there is no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold taken from the Leſſor, which the continuance of poſſeſſion doth not take from him, but where the Tenant holds over his terme, there the Freehold is diſturbed, and therefore there is a diſſeiſin: But at that preſent it ſeemed to the Iudges that there was no diverſity. But<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57352:21"/>the next terme <hi>Godfrey</hi> moved, that if Tenant for anothers life held o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Eſtate he had Feeſimple, and he granted that it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſome caſes, for if he claim to be Tenant at the Will of the Leſſor, he ſhall not gaine a Fee-ſimple: For <hi>Littleton</hi> in his Chapter of Releaſes.
<hi>108.</hi> ſaith, that Tenant at ſufferance is where a man in his own wrong doth convey Lands and Tenements at the will of him that hath the Freehold, and ſuch Occupyer claimeth nothing but at Will. But in this caſe the Tenant claimes otherwiſe then at Will of the Leſſor, he does not claim any thing but at the Will of the Leſſor; as in the caſe of
<hi>Littleton,</hi> but claimes to hold over againſt the Will of the Leſſor, which is no Tenant at ſufferance, and <hi>10 Ed. 4.</hi> If a man makes a Leaſe at Will, and the Leſſor dies, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues poſſeſſion and claims fee, the Heire ſhall have a
<hi>Mortdanceſter,</hi> and <hi>18 Ed. 4.25.</hi> If <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> dies, and the Tenant continues in, and the Tenant is impleaded, the Leſſor ſhall not be received, and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no reverſion in him, but the Tenant hath it, and <hi>22 Ed. 4.38.</hi> by
<hi>Huſſey</hi> Iuſtice, If a Termor holds over his Terme, there an Eſtate in fee is confeſt to be in him by matter of Law, but it is a deubt whether he be a Diſſeiſor or not, but it ſeemeth not, for a Treſpaſſe doth not lye againſt him before Regreſſe, and in the
<hi>7 H. 4.43.</hi> If a Guardian holds the poſſeſſion at the full age of the Heir, or Tenant for years after his terme expired, the Eſtate ſhall be judged in Fee. And in our caſe he hath not claimed to hold at Will, for he hath done contrary, for he hath made Copies.</p>
               <p>By all the Iuſtices, if Tenant at will, or for years, or at ſufferance, make a Leaſe for years, this is a Diſſeiſin, and a Tenant at will doth thereby gaine a Freehold, and thereby doth claim a greater Eſtate then he ought, and ſo it is in this caſe.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> Admitting him to be Tenant at ſufferance, the queſtion is, if he may grant Copies, and if whether they be good: and it ſeems he may, for no treſpaſſe lies againſt him, becauſe he is
<hi>Dominus pro tempore,</hi> and it is not like a Copy made by an Abator or Diſſeiſor, for it hath been adjudged that Copies made by them are void, but in this caſe his act of making Copies agrees with the Cuſtome; as in
<hi>Grisbrooks</hi> caſe, If an Adminiſtrator ſells Goods, and paies debts with the money, and after he who is Executor proves the Will, he ſhall never avoid this ſale, for that it was done according to the Will which the Executors were compelled to do: So in the <hi>12 H. 6.</hi> If a Baily cuts Trees and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires an ancient Pale, this is good, and <hi>6 R. 2.</hi> if he paies quit-rents it is good.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Popham,</hi> If a Mannor be deviſed to one, and the Deviſee enters and makes Copies, and then the Deviſe is found to be void, yet the Copies of Surrender made by ſuch Deviſee are good; but contrary where new or voluntary Copies are made by him, <hi>7 Eliz.</hi> and in the Lord
<hi>Arundells</hi> caſe, a Feoffment in fee was made of a Mannor upon condition, the Feoffee upon Condition grants voluntary Copies, thoſe are good.</p>

                  <hi>Atkins,</hi> on the contrary: And he made a difference between a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at will, and a Tenant at ſufferance, for a Tenant at will ſhall<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57352:21"/>have aid, but ſo ſhall not the other, as in the

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when he holds over he doth aſſume an Intereſt which ſhall not be thought wrongfull, for he is neither Abator nor Diſſeiſor, and therefore <hi>Dominus,</hi> and therefore the Copies made by him are good,
<hi>4 H. 7.3.</hi> Tenant at ſufferance may juſtifie for Damage-feaſant. And all the Iuſtices held for the Plaintiff, and that he that made the Copy was but Tenant at ſufferance, and not Diſſeiſor, and that he had no Fee.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy</hi> prayed the opinion of the Court if the Action would lye. And the Caſe was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Plaintiff had a Leaſe of a Parſonage, and the Defendant, not being Leſſee, nor claiming any intereſt, took the Tythes being ſet forth, and carried them away.</hi> If the Leſſor may have an account againſt ſuch Treſpaſſor, was the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manwood</hi> Iuſtice, An Account will not lye becauſe there is no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57352:25"/>and wrongs are alwaies without privity, yet I will grant that if <hi>H.</hi> receive my Rents, I may have an account againſt him, for my aſſent to have him receive it makes a privity, and when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Rent, he hath not committed any wrong againſt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not my money till it is paid: and therefore in this caſe I may reſort to my Tenant, and compell him to pay the Rent to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the receit is no wrong: But it is otherwiſe in the firſt caſe, for when the Tithes are ſet forth, they are preſently in the poſſeſſion of the Parſon, ſo that when the Defendant takes them, he is a wrong Seiſor of them, and therefore no account will lye againſt him. And ſo was it adjudged in a caſe of a Mannor in <hi>London,</hi> where one under colour of a Deviſe did occupy the Land for twenty years, which Will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was made void; and thereupon he to whom the right of the land belonged brought an account, and it was adjudged that it would not lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harper,</hi> An Account will lye againſt a Procter, ſo that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff may charge him as Procter, and it is no plea for him to ſay he is no Procter, no more then it is for a Guardian in Socage to ſay, he is not <hi>Prochein amy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyer,</hi> there are three Actions of Account. One againſt a Baily, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt a Receiver, the third againſt a Guardian in Socage. And if an Account be brought againſt a man as Receiver, he muſt be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the receipt of the money: but if the Defendant pretends he is Owner of it, it is contrary to the nature of an account, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not chargable in ſuch Action, but he may plead <hi>Ne unque ſon Baily pur account render:</hi> for in an Account (as my Brother <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> ſaid) there muſt be privity: But an Abator or an Intruder ſhall not be charged in an Account, becauſe they pretend to be Owners. But in this caſe the Leſſee may have an Action of Treſpaſſe againſt him, for the Tythes were immediatly upon the ſetting forth in the poſſeſſion of the Leſſee, and by the Statute of the <hi>31 H. 8.7.</hi> he may have an
<hi>Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione firmae:</hi> but an account will not lye in this caſe.</p>

<hi>Swainton</hi> in <hi>Norf.</hi> in fee, <hi>Secundum conſuetudinem Mannerii;</hi> the Defendant did promiſe to the Plaintiff, in conſideration the Plaintiff would permit him to occupy the ſame for the ſpace of five years, that he would pay him at the Feaſt of <hi>All-Saints</hi> next coming, and ſo yearly twenty pounds at the Feaſts of the Annunciation, and
<hi>All-Saints</hi> by equall Portions, during the terme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and alledged that he had injoyed the lands by the ſpace of a year and half, and ſo brought his Action on the <hi>Aſſumpſit.</hi> And
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> was of opinion that untill the five years were expired, no money was to be paid, becauſe the Contract was intire. But all the other Iuſtices on the contrary, for the conſideration was to pay a certain ſumme yearly, which made ſeverall duties and ſo ſeverall Actions. For by <hi>Periam,</hi> if a man be bound to pay <hi>I.S.</hi> twenty pounds in manner and forme following, <hi>viz.</hi> ten pounds at ſuch a day, and ten pounds at ſuch a day, in this caſe the Obligee cannot have an Action of Debt for the firſt, before the day of payment of the laſt ten pounds be paſt, becauſe the duty in it ſelf is an intire duty, but if a man be bound to pay <hi>I.S.</hi> ten pounds at ſuch a day, and ten pounds at ſuch a day, here the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee ſhall have his Action for the firſt, becauſe the duty was in it ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon</hi> at another day ſaid, that if a man makes a Leaſe for ten years, rendring Rent, in that caſe he may have an
<hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> for the Rent due every year: So if I covenant with you to build you twenty houſes, the Covenantee ſhall have a ſeverall action for each default.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periam,</hi> That Caſe of the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> is much to the purpoſe, for an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> is in the nature of a Covenant, and is indeed a Covenant without writing.</p>

<hi>Shard</hi> ſaid, that if the King had an Advowſon in his owne right, and a ſtranger who had no right did happen to preſent, that put the King out of poſſeſſion.

               <p>IN an Ejectment by <hi>Dorothy Michell</hi> againſt <hi>Edmund Dunton,</hi> the Caſe was; A woman makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, with a Covenant that the Leſſee ſhould repaire the houſe, with other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and then deviſed the ſame lands to the ſame Leſſee for divers years more, yeilding the like rent, and under ſuch Covenants as were in the firſt Leaſe, the Remainder over in fee, and dies, and then the firſt Leaſe for years does expire, and the Leſſee continues in by force of the ſecond Leaſe by veſture of the deviſe, and repaires not the houſes, ſo that if the firſt Leaſe had been in being, he had broke the Covenant.

And at laſt it was reſolved by all the Iuſtices, that the Will expreſſing that the firſt Leſſee ſhould have the Land obſerving the firſt Covenants, it ſhall not be now taken to be a Condition by any intent that may be collected out of the Will: for a Covenant and Condition are of ſeverall natures, the one giving Action, the other entry, and here the intent of the Will was, that although the Covenants were not performed, yet the Leſſee ſhould not forfeit his terme, but is onely bound to ſuch paine as he was at the beginning, and that was to render damages in an Action of Covenant. And Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given that the Plaintiff ſhould be barred.</p>

               <p>THe Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> brought an Action of Debt upon a Bond againſt <hi>William Bryan,</hi> which was indorſed with a Condition, That if the Defendant did permit the Plaintiff, his Executors or Aſſignes, not onely to threſh Corn in the Defendants Barn, but alſo to carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from time to time, and at all times hereafter convenient, with free egreſſe and regreſſe, or elſe to pay eight pounds upon requeſt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in truth the Defendant permitted the Corn to lye there two years, in which time the Miſe and Rats had devoured a great part of it, and then the Defendant threſht it, and the Earle therefore brought this Action: And upon Demur it ſeemed to
<hi>Walmſley</hi> that there was no forfeiture of the Bond, becauſe the Earl took not the Corn away in convenient time, for convenient time is ſuch as ſhall prejudice no perſon <hi>(Quod fuit negatum per Juſtitiar.)</hi> and here is great prejudice to the Detendant, becauſe the Plaintiff did not carry away the Corn: And he put many caſes, where things ought to be done in convenient time, as in the <hi>21 Ed. 4.</hi> where an Arbitrement ought to be performed in convenient time.

                  </hi> at ſuch a day, that then he ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of the Bargainor and his heirs, and did aſſume to make ſuch aſſurance for the ſecurity of the land as ſhould be adviſed by the Councell of the Bargainor, and the Bargainee bound himſelf in a Recognizance to performe the ſaid Covenants. And in debt upon the Recognizance, it was ſhewn that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor paid the money at the day, and had tendred to the Bargainee a Deed in which was compriſed an acquittance of payment of the money, and alſo a releaſe of all his right, and the Bargainee refuſed to ſeale it. <hi>Coke</hi> was of clear opinion that he ought to have ſealed it, for it is neceſſary to have the Deed to mention payment of the money, for otherwiſe the Bargainee and his heirs may claim the land for default of payment. <hi>Gawdy</hi> of the ſame opinion, and cited
<hi>19 Ed. 4. Popham,</hi> The caſe is not ſo clear, for if he had tendered an acquittance only, there is no doubt but the Bargainee might refuſe to ſeale it, and by the ſame reaſon he may refuſe when it is joyned to a thing that he is bound not to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeal the releaſe: but at laſt the matter was referred to Arbitration.</p>

That it was holden by the Court, that they ſhall hold by the Deviſe, becauſe that he gives another eſtate to them then deſcended, for by the deſcent each of them had a diſtinct moyety, but by the Deviſe they are Joyn-renants, and the ſurvivor ſhall have all. And <hi>Fenner</hi> ſayd, If a man had Land in Burrow-Engliſh and Guildable Lands, and deviſed all his Land to his two Sons, and dyes, both of them ſhall take joyntly, and the younger ſhall not have a diſtinct moiety in the Burrow-Engliſh, nor the elder in the Guildable Land, but they are both Joyn-tenants.</p>

<hi>Henry Henning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his brother: and the Error aſſigned was, that there was no warrant of Attorney of the Record. And it was agreed by the Bar and Bench, and adjudged error. But the great point was, if the Plaintiff could have a writ of Error? The Caſe was; <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> had
<hi>Henry</hi> his Son and three Daughters by one <hi>Venter,</hi> and the Plaintiff by another <hi>Venter,</hi> and died ſeiſed of the land intailed to him, and the Heirs Males of his body. <hi>Henry</hi> enters and makes a Feoffment, the Feoffee is impleaded, and voucheth <hi>Henry,</hi> who looſeth by default in the recovery, and dies without iſſue, and whether the Daughters which are Heirs generall, or the Plaintiff which is Heir in tail ſhall have the Error. <hi>Gawdy</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, who ſaid, that the Plaintiff could not have the Error, but the Daughters who were the Heirs to <hi>Henry,</hi> for an Action alwaies diſcends according to the right of land, and it ſeems that the Heir in Burrow En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſhall have Error or Attaint, and not the Heir at the Common Law, which was agreed by all on both ſides: but it was ſaid, that this varies much from the preſent caſe, for two reaſons; One, becauſe he came in as Vouchee which is to recover a Fee-ſimple, and he ſhall render a Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in value, which is diſcendable to the Heirs at the Common Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he hath no Eſtate-tail. <hi>Bromley</hi> Solicitor, and <hi>Plowden contra,</hi> and laid this ground, that in all caſes where a recovery is had againſt one by erroneous proceſſe, or falſe verdict, he which is grieved ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of it, although he be not party or privy to the firſt Iudgment, and therefore at the Common Law if a Recovery be had againſt Tenant for life, he in the Reverſion ſhall have Error of Attaint after his death, and now by the Statute of <hi>R 2.</hi> in his life, ſo in a <hi>Precipe,</hi> if the Tenant vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Vouchee looſeth by default, the Tenant ſhall have Error, for the Iudgment was againſt him, and he looſeth his term: and in the <hi>44 Ed: 4.6.</hi> in a Treſpaſſe of Battery againſt two, one pleads, and it is found againſt him, and the plea of the other not determined, damages by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Verdict is given againſt them both, which (if they be exceſſive) the other ſhall have an Attaint. And
<hi>Bromley</hi> ſaid, there could not be a caſe put, but where he that hath the loſſe by the recovery ſhould have alſo the remedy; and
<hi>Baker</hi> cited <hi>9.

So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in our caſe, the Bargainor was ſeiſed of the land when the <hi>Scrie facias</hi> was brought; and if a man makes a Leaſe for life, rendring Rent, and then the Leſſor bargains and ſells the Reverſion, and before the Inrolement the Rent is behind, and the Bargainer demands the Rent which was not paid, and then the Deed is inrolled, yet he cannot enter for the forfeiture, which I have ſeen adjudged: &amp; in the <hi>28 H. 8. Dyer.</hi> Diſſeiſee of one acre makes a Releaſe to the Diſſeiſor of all his lands, and delivers it as an Eſcroll to be delivered to the Diſſeiſor, and then he diſſeiſeth him of another acre, and then the Deed is delivered to the Diſſeiſor, yet the right in the ſecond acre ſhall not paſſe. And he much rolled on Sir <hi>Richard Brochets</hi> caſe, <hi>26 Eliz.</hi> who made a Recognizance to
<hi>Morgan</hi> upon condition to convey unto him all his lands whereof he was ſeiſed the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> and it hapned that one

<hi>April,</hi> but the Deed was not inrolled untill the <hi>24.</hi> day of
<hi>May</hi> after: And the queſtion was, if the Conuzor was bound to convey theſe lands, or not, and adjudged that he was not, for inaſmuch as the Deed was not inrolled the ffrſt day of <hi>May,</hi> he was not ſeiſed, and great miſchief would enſue if the Law ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57352:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>for no man will know againſt whom to bring his Action, for a Bargain and Sale before Inrolement may be done ſecretly.
<hi>Herne</hi> Serjeant, The Bargainee is ſeiſed before Inrolement, and by the Statute of <hi>5 Eliz.</hi> which wills, that none ſhall convert land uſed to tillage, unleſſe he puts other land to tillage within ſix months, yet none will ſay that it is a breach of the Statute, although Paſture be preſently converted to tillage, and he cited <hi>Chilburns</hi> cafe, <hi>6 Eliz. Dyer 229.</hi> that proves that before the Inrolement land paſſeth to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee, and the Bargainee hath a Freehold in him before the Inrole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whereof his wife ſhall be endowed, and if the Bargainor levies a Fine, or acknowledge of Statute, the Bargainee ſhall avoid them, and deaſed the caſe of <hi>Morgan,</hi> cited by the other ſide, and cited the caſe of <hi>6 Ed 6.</hi> where were two Ioynt-tenants, and one of them bargained and ſold his Moyety, and then the other Ioyntenant died, and then the Deed was inrolled, there nothing paſſed but a Moyety, but it ſeems in that caſe that by the Bargain and Sale the Ioynture is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before the Inrolement, ſo that there is no Survivorſhip, but the Book ſpeaks not of it; and if a Bargainee be of lands held of the King without licenſe of a alienation, there the forfeiture to the King ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the firſt delivery of the Deed. <hi>Warberton contra.</hi> Before the Inrolement there is but a commencement of the Bargain, and before all circumſtances in the Deed mentioned, are performed, it is no Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and I hold the Deed ſhall have relation to the delivery to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Charges, &amp; Contracts, but as to ſtrangers it ſhall not have ſuch relation. If Tenant for life bargains and ſells his land to another and his Heirs, and then makes a Feoffment in fee to another before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolement, this is no forfeiture. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> A releaſe made to a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee before inrolement is void, then if this
<hi>Scire facias</hi> be well brought, no Act of the Bargainee ſhall avoid it. <hi>Walmſley,</hi> If there be a Bargainee, and before the Inrolement the Bargainor enfeoffs him, he is in by the Feoffment and not by the Bargain, which proves that no eſtate is really in the Bargainee before Inrolement,
<hi>Kingſmill,</hi> The reaſon of that is, becauſe it is out of the Statute, for the Bargain and Sale was onely delivered, and he ſaid that the wife of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee in ſuch caſe ſhall be indowed: But the Court denied that, and all agreed that the wife of the Bargainee before Inrolement ſhall not be indowed. <hi>Kingſmill</hi> ſaid. that it was a uſuall courſe in a Recovery to make the Bargainee Tenant of the <hi>Precipe.</hi> And it was ſaid by all the Iuſtices, that if Tenant for life be impleaded, the Bargainee of the Reverſion after Inrolement ſhal be received, and yet (if hanging the Writ) he purchaſe the Reverſion, he ſhall not. And after many arguments it was adjudged that the <hi>Scire facias</hi> was not well awarded: And Iudgment given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>IN a Treſpaſſe, the Defendant juſtified the taking of a Furnace fixt to the earth; becauſe the Sheriff upon an intent ſold it to him. And by the Court it was held a good diſcharge: for if a ſtranger takes my Horſe, and ſells him, a Treſpaſſe will not lye againſt the Vendee, but a Detinue. But if one ſells my Horſe, and a ſtranger takes him, he is a Treſpaſſor. <hi>Walmeſley and Beaumond,</hi> Although ſuch Furnace be fixed by the Termor, yet he may take it away within the term, but<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57352:42"/>the Sheriff cannot attach it; and the Termor may pull down a Wall made by him, and it is not waſte. And at another day the caſe was recited to be thus. The Leſſee made a Furnace for the uſe of a Dyer, and fixed it to the wall of his houſe, and the Leſſee being condemned in debt, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff came to the Furnace, and put his hands upon it, and delivered it to the Defendant; and the Leſſee brought a Treſpaſſe.
<hi>Glanvill,</hi> A Furnace may be delivered in execution, and the houſe never the worſe, but otherwiſe of the doors, becauſe the Leſſee cannot be without them, <hi>42 Ed. 3.6.</hi> it is not waſte to take away a Furnace, <hi>21 H. 6.26.</hi> ſaid there that the Heir ſhall have ſuch Furnace, but this does not prove that it is not a Chattell, but the cauſe wherefore the Heir ſhall have it, it is becauſe it is annext to the land, as in the caſe of writings which are meer Chattels. <hi>Beaumound,</hi> It is doubly fixt, to the land and to the wall; and it is clear that the Sheriff cannot take it from the wall. <hi>Dyer,</hi> The diverſity is when the Furnace is fixt to the middle of the houſe, and when to the wall, for the Termor may take it from the middle of the houſe, but not from the wall, for the wall is worſe for taking it away, and therefore it is waſte: And to this <hi>Owen</hi> agreed.</p>

               <p>IN an Ejectment, the caſe was; The Queen being Lady of the Mannor of <hi>Winterburne</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> by her Steward did licenſe a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholder for life to make a Leaſe for three years, if he ſhould ſo long live, the Copyholder did make a Leaſe generally to the plaintiff for three years, who<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57352:43"/>being ejected brought this Action. <hi>Stephen.</hi> The Action will not lye becauſe the Copyholder hath not purſued his licence, for licenſe or authority muſt be purſued very ſtrictly as well in form as ſubſtance, <hi>10 H. 7.</hi> licenſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoff by Deed, or licenſe to impark <hi>300.</hi> acres, he cannot enfeoff by paroll, or impark but <hi>100.</hi> acres, and it was reſolved the laſt Terme in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, that if the King licenſe his Tenant to alien, he cannot alien to one in tail, the remainder to the Donor in fee: And ſo in our caſe where he makes a Leaſe for <hi>3.</hi> years abſolutely, he hath not performed his licenſe. <hi>Gawdy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> for when his licenſe is to make a Leaſe for yeares, if he ſo long live, theſe words <hi>(If he ſo long live)</hi> are but Surpluſage; for the Law ſaies, that if Copyholder for life makes a Leaſe for years, and dies, the Leaſe is determined, and therfore the clauſe in the Licenſe is no more then the Law ſaies, and ſo is void. <hi>Quod ſuit conceſſum per totam curiam. Fenner,</hi> The Condition in the Licenſe is meerly void, for the Lord gives nothing by the Licenſe, but only doth diſpence with the forfeiture, and the Leſſee is in by the Copyholder and not by the Lord, for the Lord cannot condition with him in his Licenſe. <hi>Clench,</hi> The Lord may licenſe on Condition, as where the Lord doth licence his Copyholder on condition that the Leſſee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the houſe, or ſhall not cut Trees, for otherwiſe the Copyholder may cut them, and the Lord hath no remedy, for his Licenſe is a diſpenſation of the forfeiture. <hi>Popham contra,</hi> A Condition to a Licenſe is void, as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to make a Leaſe for years, on condition that he pay <hi>20 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> the ſecond year, this is void for the reaſon given by my brother <hi>Fenner,</hi> for the licenſe does not give a right, but only executes it, as a Livery, or Attornment; but a Limitation to ſuch Licenſe is good, as licenſe to alien for two years, he cannot alien for three, but in our caſe the Condition &amp; the Limitation made by the Lord is void: and the difference is between a Copyholder in fee, and a Copyholder for life, for if the Lord doth licenſe his Copyholder in fee to make a Leaſe for three years if he ſo long live, and he makes a Leaſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, this is no forfeiture, for this Leaſe ſhall be a good intereſt againſt the Heir of the Copyholder, but otherwiſe of a Copyholder for life.

               <p>THe Caſe was, A Church in which there had been a Parſon and a Vicar time out of mind, and the Parſon uſed to have the great Tythes, and the Vicar the ſmall, and for the ſpace of forty years laſt paſt, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Parſon had Tythes paid him out of a feild of twenty acres of Corne, and now the feild is ſowed with Saffron, and the Vicar ſued for the Tythes of Saffron in the Court Chriſtian, and the Parſon had a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Coke.</hi> I conceive the Parſon ſhall have the Tythes, for by the Statute of <hi>2 H. 6.</hi> it is enacted that Tythes ſhall be paid as hath been uſed the laſt forty years, and this hath been alwaies tythable to the Parſon, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ground be otherwiſe imployed, yet the Parſon ſhall have the Tythes; and ſo was it in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> in the Caſe of a Park, where the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proſcribed <hi>Pro modo decimandi,</hi> to be paid three ſhillings fours pence, for all Tythes riſing out of the ſaid Park, and although the Park was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter converted to arable, yet no other Tythes ſhall be paid.</p>

                  <hi>Popham,</hi> It hath been adjudged otherwiſe in

<hi>Wray</hi> chief Juſtice, and there reaſon was, becauſe that a Warrant of Attorney in a <hi>Precipe</hi> of a Houſe, Woods, and Land, is onely of Land, which proves that land does comprehend all of them, and therefore I conceive, if a man does deviſe, or bargain and ſell all his lands in

<hi>Formedon.</hi> The queſtion was, Whether by the entry of the Son the Fine was ſo defeated that the Eſtate-tail was not barred. <hi>Dyer,</hi> The Eſtate tail is barred, and made a difference where the Fine is defeated by entry, by reaſon of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-tail, and where it is defeated by entry by reaſon of another eſtate-tail, as in <hi>40 Eliz.</hi> Tenant in tail diſcontinues, and diſſeiſeth the Diſcontinuee, and levies a Fine to a ſtranger, and retakes an Eſtate in Fee, before the Proclamations paſſe, the Diſcontinuee enters, and then the Tenant in tail dies ſeiſed, and adjudged that the Iſſue is not remitted, for the Statute <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> ſaies, That a Fine levied of lands any way intailed by the party that levies the Fine ſhall bind him, and ſo it is not materiall whether he were ſeiſed by force of the Eſtate-tail, or by reaſon of another Eſtate, or whether he have no Eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57352:45"/>And all the Iuſtices were of opinion that the Eſtate was barred, for although the diſcontinue had avoided the Fine by the poſſeſſion, yet the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate-tail remains concluded, and the ſame ſhall not enter by force of the Eſtate-tail, but by force of the Fee which he had by diſcontinuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham,</hi> Avoidance of a Fine at this day differs much from avoidance of a Fine at the Common Law, for it appears by the <hi>16 Ed:
3.</hi> that if a Fine at the Common Law be defeated by one who hath right, it is defeated againſt all, but at this day the Law is contrary, for if a man be diſſeiſed, and the Diſſeiſor die ſeiſed his Heir within age, and he is diſſeiſed by a ſtranger who levies a Fine, and then five years paſſe, the Heire ſhall avoid this by his nonage, yet the firſt Diſſeiſee is bound for ever, for the Infant ſhall not avoid the Fine againſt all, but only to reſtore the poſſeſſion. And therefore it was adjudged in the Lord <hi>Sturtons</hi> Caſe, <hi>24 Eliz.</hi> where Lands were given to him and his Wife, and the Heires of him, and he died, and his Iſſue entred and levied a Fine to a ſtranger, and before the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations paſſed, the Mother enters, it was adjudged that the Iſſue was barred, for the Wife ſhall not avoid this but for her own Eſtate: And ſo if a ſtranger enters to the uſe of him who hath right, this ſhall not avoid the Fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner</hi> did agree to this, and ſaid that it had been ſo adjudged; but all the Iuſtices agreed, that the Eſtate-taile being barred, the entry ſhall go to the benefit of him who hath moſt right to the poſſeſſion, and that is the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; and therefore the Plaintiff in the <hi>Formedon</hi> hath good Title to the Land, but onely to the Fee, and not to the Intaile, for that is barred by the Fine.</p>

               <p>IN a Replevin the Caſe was; <hi>John Winchfeild</hi> was ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, and by his Will did deviſe all his Lands and Tenements to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Winchfeild</hi> and his Heires, and before his death made a Deed of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment of the ſame Lands, and when he ſealed the Feoffment, he asked, <hi>If this Feoffment will not hurt this laſt Will, &amp; if it will not, I will ſeal it?</hi> And then he ſealed it, and made a Letter of Attorney to make Livery in any of the ſaid Lands, the Attorney made Livery, but not of the Lands which were in queſtion, and then the Teſtator died. And the queſtion was, if the Deviſee or Heire of the Deviſor ſhould have the Land.

                  <hi>Periam.</hi> As to the caſe of the Will, I conceive it is voyd to both, becauſe it cannot be known who ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I am ſure the Law hath been taken as I have ſaid; and there was a Caſe in the Vpper Bench, where a man one day made part of his Will, and another day made another part, which was repugnant to the firſt part, and adjudged that the laſt was good, and the firſt voyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periam.</hi> I agree to this Caſe, for here is a difference in time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> So is there in my Caſe; for when I am writing my Will, I am thinking how I ſhall diſpoſe of my eſtate, and it ſhall be intended that I have leaſt adviſed concerning that which I have done laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> A Vſe is not to be compared to a Will, for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> hath made it an eſtate and then by the
<hi>19</hi> of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> If a man limits an eſtate at the beginning of a Deed, he cannot after abridge it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periam.</hi> I put this Caſe: If a man covenants upon conſideration to be ſeized to the uſe of himſelf for life, and after to the uſe of his ſon: but he further ſayes, that his meaning is, his wife ſhall have it for her life, this is not a voyd Clauſe, but good to the wife; and the Caſe was adjourned till next Term. And <hi>Harris</hi> argued again, and ſaid, that a Vſe was but matter of truſt, and for that it is apparent that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was that the wife ſhould have nothing, there is no reaſon that another conſtruction ſhould be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> The limitation of the Vſe is but a declaration how the Vſe ſhall be, and does not give any thing; and the opinion of the Court was againſt the Plaintiff who was Leſſee of the woman, and that the laſt Clauſe does countermand the firſt, as to the Mannour of <hi>Stapeley.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Harris.</hi> The Plaintiff ſhall be barred, for the other ſhall be named with him, for the Releaſe is voyd; for when the Church becomes voyd, it is a thing in action, and of privity and confidence, and cannot be releaſed nor transferred.</p>

                  <hi>Dyer 283. a. 28 H. 8.26. a.</hi> Where it is ſaid, that it cannot be granted over, no more than an Executor may releaſe his Executorſhip to his companion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beaumont.</hi> In my opinion it is not a <hi>Choſe in action,</hi> but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which the Executors have; and by the <hi>14 H.
4.</hi> and <hi>14 H. 6.</hi> If a man be ſeized of an Advowſon in the right of his wife, and the Church is voyd, and the wife dyes, yet the husband ſhall preſent, which proves it is not a <hi>Choſe in action;</hi> for in the <hi>49 Edw. 3.23.</hi> the husband ſhall not have an obligation that was made to his wife;<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57352:50"/>and in our caſe by this avoydance the Church is become an intereſt and a Chattell: and therefore one Ioyntenant may releaſe to another by reaſon of their privity: although they have no poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner.</hi> The releaſe is <hi>Totum Statum jus &amp; titulum,</hi> but here he hath no eſtate nor poſſeſſion, and therefore the releaſe is void. And to prove that there is no eſtate nor poſſeſſion, it is proved by the pleadings of the grant of the next avoydance, for he ſhews that the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came voyd, and that <hi>ea ratione pertinet ad ipſum preſentare,</hi> and not by force, whereof he was poſſeſt, and if none hath the advowſon which becomes voyd, and the Lord claymes the advowſon, yet he ſhall not have the preſent avoydance, and as to the caſe of the Ioyntenants, one cannot releaſe to the other for default of poſſeſſion for the releaſe <hi>inanes</hi> by reaſon of their joynt, poſſeſſion which is out of them, but releaſe of the Demandant to the Vouchee is good by reaſon of the privity of Law that is betwixt them; and in <hi>11 H. 4.</hi> He who hath right after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent is inſtituted and inducted, may confirme his eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Releaſe here is good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> We are all agreed that the Releaſe is void, and gave Iudgment that the Plaintiff ſhould be baned.</p>

If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent may be removed was the Queſtion: <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, that the Doctors of the Civill Law informed him, that the Law Spirituall was that for <hi>Symony</hi> the Patron loſt his preſentment, and the Ordinary ſhall preſent, and if he preſent not within ſix months, then the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, and then the King.</p>

                  </hi> Rent, and then the King being ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Crankford,</hi> of which the place in Queſtion was parcell, does grant his Mannor of
<hi>Crankford,</hi> and his Mannor of <hi>Freemington,</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Exceter</hi> and his heirs, who by his Will does deviſe Legacies to his ſervants, and does deviſe that all his Legacies ſhall be payd out of the Mannors of <hi>Freem ngton Uplaing</hi> and <hi>Crankford.</hi> All which Mannors I give to my Coſen <hi>Blunt</hi> and his heires. And the Defendant, as ſervant to <hi>Baker</hi> who was heir to the Marqueſs, did eject the Plaintiff; the queſtion was, if by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of the Mannor of
<hi>Freemington</hi> the Rent of <hi>13 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> did paſſe or not. if it does not paſſe, then by the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> the

               <p>
                  <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> for the Plaintiffe. The ſeigniory does not paſſe by the deviſe of the Mannor, for the intent thereof ſhall be collected, by the words of the Will. <hi>15 H. 7.12. a. 19 H. 8.9. &amp;
6.</hi> but here he limits a diſtreſſe out of a Lordſhip, which cannot be <hi>3 H. 6.</hi> Alſo it is doubtfull if the ſeignory being entire, may be divided by force of the Statute of the <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> And I thinke not; for when the Statute ſayes that the lands deviſed ſhall be deviſed into three parts, and that is to be underſtood of ſuch an eſtate as may be divided, but ſo cannot a Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory: For put the caſe that the Lord held by a Hauke, the whole Mannor ſhall deſcend and cannot be divided, and ſo
<hi>de catalla Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. Fenner contra.</hi> For it ſeems to me that the ſeignory paſſeth, and ſo it ſhall be, if he held but a meſualty
<hi>7 Ed. 4.</hi> A man held by Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almoigne, he ſhall ſay, <hi>infra feodum ſuum,</hi> and in reputation amongſt men, a ſeigniory is a Mannor: for if a man makes a feoffment of a Mannor, with livery where he hath no Mannor, yet ſhall it paſſe, <hi>7 E. 3.</hi> Where a Mannor paſſeth by the name of Knights Fee. And as to the intirenes of the ſeigniory it is eaſily anſwered for although the rent were entire, yet it may be ſevered, for a Rent Charge is entire, yet a proportionment may be made thereof <hi>44 Ed. 3.</hi> To which the Court agreed that the Rent without doubt might be ſevered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> For the Plaintiff, the Queſtion is if the Rent paſſeth by the name of a Mannor to the Deviſees. If a Grandmother deviſeth land to her daughter <hi>J.S.</hi> Whereas ſhe is her daughters daughter, yet this is good, becauſe in common ſpeaking ſhe is ſo called, but here the words are not apt, nor uſed in common ſpeaking,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Rent ſhould be taken for a Mannor, and therefore it is voyd, as a gift to the right heirs of <hi>J.S.</hi> who is attaint <hi>19 H.
8.</hi> And he concluded with this difference: that where the words have any affinity or likelihood<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57352:51"/>to the Mannor, then it will paſſe by the name of a Mannor. As if a man deviſeth his houſe and land by the name of a Mannor it ſhall paſſe. But here being but a ſervice, it is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy cont.</hi> For if it the Rent paſſe not nothing ſhall paſſe, which is a hard conſtruction on a Will. For <hi>21 Rich.
2.</hi> Deviſe <hi>27.</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <hi>Eccleſiae ſancti Andreae</hi> is a good deviſe to the Parſon of the Church.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Brett</hi> and <hi>Rigdens</hi> Caſea man deviſed a Mannor in which he had nothing, and after purchaſed the Mannor, the deviſe is good. And in <hi>26 H. 6.</hi> feoffment <hi>12.</hi> Land will not paſſe by deed by the name of a houſe, but land will paſſe by the name of a <hi>Carue,</hi> and a <hi>Carue</hi> by the name of a Mannor, and I hold that the Rent in this caſe will paſſe by the name of the Mannor, for a Mannor does conſiſt of Demeſnes ſervices, and rent may be called a Mannor aſwell as a <hi>Carue,</hi> and and the King gives it by the name of a Mannor to the Deviſor, and that is the reaſon that the Deviſor calls it a Mannor: And if you grant to me an Advowſon by the name of the Church and Rectory, and I deviſe the Rectory, the Advowſon and the Church will paſſe by the name of Rectory: And in <hi>Plouden. 194.</hi> A man did let his houſe and great demeſnes rendring Rent, and did deviſe to another all his Farme; there the Deviſee ſhall have all the Rent and the Reverſion alſo.</p>

                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> For the Queen ſaid. That if a Lapſe be fallen to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, if the Patron doth preſent before the Biſhop hath Collated, he ought to receive his Clerk, but where it is divolved to the King, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron by no means can defeate the King, but he may remove his Clerke at his pleaſure, but if ſuch Incumbent be preſent after ſuch Lapſe, and die, then the title of the King is gone, and his time paſſed by the act of God: but in our Caſe the avoydance which does ouſt the King from his Lapſe, is avoidance by reaſon of Recuſancy to pay Tithes, which is the proper act of the Incumbent, as is a reſignation, and no ſuch avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance being by the act of the party himſelf ſhall ouſt the King of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. for in the <hi>2 H. 9.</hi> In annuitie againſt an Abbot, who reſigns the Writ ſhall not abate, for then the Plaintiff ſhall never have a good Writ. So in our caſe, if the King be outed of his Lapſe by ſuch deviſes, he ſhall never have a Lapſe, for every one will uſurp upon the Kings<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57352:52"/>Lapſe, and will preſently reſign or miſdemeſn himſelf whereby to avoid the Lapſe.

               <p>By <hi>Pigot.</hi> A writ brought againſt a Prior ſhall not abate, although the Prior be not depoſed, for it is his own fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner.</hi> This Lapſe is given the King by his prerogative, but on this Condition, that he take it in due time: for ſo is the nature of things lapſed, for if after a title accrued to the King he ſuffer uſurpation, and the Incumbent die, his Lapſe is loſt, for the nature of the Lapſe is ſuch that it muſt be taken at its time, and where the title of the King is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a time, there he ſhall not have his prerogative: for a prerogative cannot alter eſtates. As if the King grant a ſeigniory in groſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, and the Tenant to the Lord dies without heir, whereby the tenant eſcheates, the ſeigniory is extinct, and the Rent of the King is gone, aſwell as it is in the caſe of a Common perſon. And ſo if the King have a Rent <hi>feck</hi> for life out of my land, if I die he cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreine in my land for the arrerages as he may in my life time. And ſo where the Statute gives <hi>Annum diem &amp; vaſtum</hi> to the King, yet he ſhall not have it after the death of the Tenant for life, ſo if the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Rent upon a Leaſe to an Eſtranger, and the ſtranger enters in reſpect of the land, whereby his entire rent is ſuſpended, now the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the King alſo is ſuſpended during that time, for the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be attendant upon the rent <hi>22 H. 3.</hi> If a man grant a Rent upon condition to ceaſe during the minority of his heir, and after this Rent comes to the King, and the Grantee dies, the Rent ſhall ceaſe during the minority of his heir: ſo that by all theſe caſes the reaſon appears that the nature of the Lapſe is to be taken <hi>hac vice,</hi> and the King muſt take it then, or not at all: and where it is objected that by this means every Lapſe may be taken from the King: I conceive that far greater inconvenience will be to the Patrons on the other ſide: for when a Lapſe is devolded to the King, and a ſtranger preſents, if then the true Patron may not preſent untill the death of ſuch Incumbent, perhaps the Incumbent will reſign, or be deprived, and a ſtranger ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented again and again in like manner, and ſo by this means the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron ſhall never continue his advowſon, for by the Couin between the ſtranger, and the neglect of the King to take his Lapſe, the Inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN an Ejectment a man makes a Leaſe, rendring Rent, with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that the Leſſee ſhall repair the houſes, with other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Conditions of re-entry for not performance, and then he deviſed the ſame land to the ſame Leſſee for divers years after the firſt years expired, yielding the ſame Rent, and under the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as in the former Leaſe, and he deviſed the remainder in fee to the Plaintiff, and the firſt Leaſe expires, and the Defendant being poſſeſt<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57352:53"/>by force of his ſecond Leaſe, doth not repair the houſes; and if the Plaintiff might enter, was the queſtion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hanam,</hi> for the Plaintiff. It is not: for to a ſurrender three things are incident. Firſt, an actuall poſſeſſion in him who ſurrenders.

Thirdly, conſent and agreement between the parties: But to all theſe, the Plaintiff was a ſtranger, and therefore no ſurrender. For if I let land to you for ſo many years as <hi>J.S.</hi> ſhall name, if he names the years, it ſhall be good from that time, and not before: but if I let land for ſo many years as my Executors ſhall name, this is not good, for I cannot have Executors in my life time, and when I am dead I cannot aſſent, ſo in this caſe there ought to be a mutuall aſſent between the Leſſor and Leſſee.</p>

               <p>IN an action of falſe impriſonment.

And hereupon the Plaintiff demurred. And it ſeemed to the Iuſtices that it was no good plea: for although the Conſtable at the Common Law is keeper of the Peace, yet this does not belong to his Office, but if he had juſtified as Officer, then perhaps it had been good. And afterwards,
<hi>viz. Hillar. 33 Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then
<hi>Glanvill</hi> ſaid. That it was a good juſtification, for any perſon may do it. For if I ſee <hi>A.</hi> ready to kill <hi>B.</hi> I ought to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him of his purpoſe. And in the <hi>22 Aſſ. 50.</hi> the Defendant juſtified becauſe the Plaintiff was madd and did a great deale of miſchief, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he impriſoned him. And in <hi>10 Eliz.</hi> which caſe I have heard in this Court. The Conſtable took a madd man, and put him in priſon. where he dyed, and the Conſtable was indicted of this, but was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: for the act was legall, and ſo here in this Caſe, if the infant had dyed for want of meat, it had been murder in the Plaintiff.

                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> It was ill done of the Plaintiff, but that ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by due courſe of Law, for a Conſtable cannot impriſon at his pleaſure, but he may ſtay the party, and carry him to a Iuſtice of Peace to be examin'd.</p>

And if an ejectment be maintenable in which a Terme ſhall be recover'd, it ſhall be alſo maintenable in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> in which a preſentment may be recovered.</p>

                  <hi>Drew cont.</hi> At the Common Law Executors have no remedy for a perſonall wrong, <hi>quia moritur cum perſona:</hi> for upon the death of the Teſtator, Executors have no remedy for arrears of Rent at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, but only the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> And it cannot be that the Executors in this caſe are within the Statute of <hi>4 Ed. 3.</hi> For that Statute intends onely to remedy ſuch things as are avaylable to the Teſtator, and are aſſets to pay debts: and although Executors may have a
<hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> that is intended of a diſturbance, <hi>fait al eux,</hi> but <hi>contra,</hi> if it be done <hi>in vita Teſtatoris.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> I conceive no actions will lie. For the Statute gives an action for the taking of goods and ſuch like things, but here is no taking, but only a diſturbance, which may be done by
<hi>Parol.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Windham,</hi> and <hi>Anderſon.</hi> agreed with
<hi>Perryam,</hi> and whereas it hath been ſaid, that this cannot be Aſſetts. Put the caſe that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator had judgment to recover damages, ſhall not that be Aſſetts? and why may the damages here recovered be Aſſetts, and why ſhall not the grant of the Advowſon be Aſſetts in the hands of the Executor aſwell as in the hands of the iſſue.

               <p>THe Caſe on a ſpeciall verdict was thus, <hi>Mapps</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant made a Leaſe of the Parſonage of <hi>Broncaſter</hi> by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Covenanted by the ſame Deed, to ſave the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff harmleſs and indemnified: and alſo all the proffits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and premiſſes, againſt <hi>Philip Blount,</hi> the Parſon of
<hi>Broncaſter;</hi> and hereupon a writ of Covenant was brought againſt
<hi>Mapps,</hi> and the breach aſſigned was, that <hi>Blount</hi> had entred and ejected the Plaintiff. And one point was, if this ſhall be accounted the Deed of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, becauſe the Defedant delivered his part of the Indenture to the Plaintiff as his Deed, but the Plaintiff did not deliver the counterpart to him. But the opinion of the Court was, that this was a good Deed of the Defendants, and <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſaid, that the ſafeſt way had been to deliver his part as an Eſcroll to be his Deed, when the Plaintiff delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Counterpaine: But a great doubt was made in this caſe, becauſe it was not ſhewed that <hi>Blount</hi> entred by a Title, and then he ſhall be taken to have entred by wrong, and ſo the Covenant not broken, for to ſave harmeleſs is only from legall harmes, as it is in
<hi>Swettenhams</hi> Caſe <hi>Dyer 306.</hi> Where the Warden of the
<hi>Fleet</hi> ſuffered a priſoner to eſcape, and took a bond of him to ſave him harmeleſs, and then the Warden was ſued upon an eſcape, and thereupon he ſued the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adiudged that the bond was not forfeit, becauſe the partie was not legally in execution, and therefore the Warden could not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for the eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Padſy cont.</hi> The Diverſitie is where the Covenant is generall, and where it is ſpeciall, for in this caſe it being ſpeciall to ſave harmeleſs from <hi>Blount,</hi> he ought to defend againſt him his entry, be it by good title or by wrong, and ſo is <hi>Catesbies</hi> Eaſe.
<hi>Dyer. 3.28.</hi> Where the Leſſor covenanted, that the Leſſee ſhould injoy his terme <hi>ſine ejectione vel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptione alicujus,</hi> the Leſſee brought an action of Covenant becauſe a ſtranger entred, and did not ſay he had any title, and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> The Covenant is broke. For if <hi>Blount</hi> diſturbe him ſo that he cannot take the proffits, this is a breach of the Covenant, for hereby the Plaintiff is damnified. <hi>2 Ed. 4.15.</hi> where the Condition of a Bond was, that the Obliger ſhould warrant and defend the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ever, and againſt all, and the Defendant pleaded, that he had ſuch a Warrant, and there it was held by <hi>Danby</hi> to be no plea, becauſe he cannot warrant unleſs the other be impleaded. And there it was ſaid by <hi>Danby</hi> and <hi>Needham,</hi> that if the obligee be outed by a ſtranger, who hath no title, the Obligation is forfeit by reaſon of this word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wray</hi> agreed, and ſaid, that this caſe was not like to the Eaſe of <hi>26 H. 8.3.</hi> where the Leſſor Covenanted to warrant the land to the Leſſee, for there he ſhall not have a Covenant, if he be wrongfully outed; but our caſe is to ſave harmeleſs, which is of greater force than to warrant, for to warrant Land is only upon the title, but here, be the Leſſee outed by wrong or by title, yet is the Covenant broken, to which the other Iuſtices agreed.</p>

<note place="margin">Statut Weſtm. 2. cap. 4.</note> wherefore he brought his action of waſte, to which ſhe appeared and pleaded nothing, for which he had Iudgment to recover. The Plaintiff ſaid that no waſte was committed, and the Defendant Demurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Owen</hi> for the Defendant. a <hi>Quod ei deforceat,</hi> lies not in this caſe, for ſuch Writ is grounded upon a recovery by default in a reall action, but a waſte is a meere perſonall action. And therefore in the <hi>2 H. 4.</hi> in a waſte againſt the husband and wife, the wife ſhall not be received: alſo it will not lie in this caſe, becauſe here is no default within the intent of the Statute, for the Statute intends to relieve defaults after appearance, and therefore all the Iudgment in this Writ is that the recovery was by default, and if there was a default in pleading, it is a default, but not within the Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanvill cont.</hi> No waſte is committed, and ſo the recovery ſhall not bind, for it appears in the <hi>8 Ed. 4.</hi> by
<hi>Weſt.</hi> That this action was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided inſtead of a Writ of right, and there is no queſtion but a Writ of right will lie here, and this Writ is of the ſame nature. And <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Plowden</hi> in his Reading ſaid, that this action will lie upon a recovery upon a Writ of waſte, aſwell as in other actions, for the recovery is not upon the Inquiry of the Iury, but upon default. And it is alſo a reall action <hi>7 Ed. 3. 28 Ed. 3.30.</hi> If the husband make default herein, the wife ſhall be received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> There is no queſtion but this action lies upon a recovery in waſte, but if this be a default within the Statute is a doubt, for if this ſhould be ſuffer d, it were very miſchievous: for then contempts ſhall be favoured, which was never the intention of the Statute, and therefore it will not lie where there is a default after appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> of the ſame opinion, for this caſe differs much from the Statute of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> for this Statute gives remedy to a third perſon upon default of the particular Tenant, and therefore upon this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, the intent of the partie, who makes default, is more regarded, than the manner of the default, and therefore it ſhall be taken largely. But here is default in the party himſelf, and he ſhall have no favour againſt his willfull default, for every <hi>nihil dicit,</hi> is a confeſſion of it ſelf, for thereupon it is ſuppoſed that nothing can be ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Windham.</hi> I hold that a <hi>Quod ei deforceat</hi> will not lie in a Writ of waſte, for the inquiry of the Iury is the cauſe of the Iudgment. But he agreed that default within the Statute is intended ſuch default, that in it ſelf is the cauſe of the Iudgment, but here the Iudgment is given upon contempt and refuſall of the party and therefore no favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perryam.</hi> This action cannot be compar'd to a writ of right which is grounded upon the right, and not on the Iudgment, but the form in the <hi>Quod ei deforceat</hi> is ſet down in the Statute which ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Statute gives this action upon a default, and here is no<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57352:58"/>default, for it cannot be a default where the partie appears and hath no day in Court, but he doubted much if it lay in awrit of waſte, becauſe the damages are the principall: but as the caſe is here, it will not lie. And to prove that a <hi>nihil dicit</hi> is a confeſſion he cited <hi>Pepyſs</hi> Eaſe in the Comentaries <hi>438.</hi> And at laſt Iudgment was given that the Writ would not lye.</p>

<hi>Portman,</hi> who takes it, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff as executor to
<hi>Thomas</hi> brought an action of treſpaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ewens,</hi> for the Defendant, one Ioyntenant cannot make a Leaſe to his companion, no more than one may infeof the other, by reaſon they have joynt poſſeſſion <hi>10 Ed. 4.3. 2 R. 2.</hi> Extinguiſhment <hi>3.</hi> Alſo the words here are not ſufficient to make a Leaſe, but admitting this, yet the ſurvivor ſhall have the corn of that part which belongs to him, for by this Leaſe the Ioynture is ſevered, and then the Survivor ſhall have that which grows on his part: For it two Ioyntenants ſowe their land, and one of them letts his moytie for years; and he, who did not let, dyes, the other ſhall have the corn as Survivor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pyne cont.</hi> Although one Ioyntenant cannot inteof another, becauſe he cannot make livery, becauſe he hath poſſeſſion before, yet may he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to his companion, and ſo may he make a Leaſe for years, for there is no need of any livery, and by the <hi>22 H. 6.43.</hi> If one Ioyntenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feofs another, this ſhall enure by way of confirmation. And <hi>14 H. 6.10.</hi> One Ioyntenant may put out his companion by this means, for he may clayme a Leaſe from him, and then a Releaſe, and if it be a good Leaſe, then the Executors ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham.</hi> The action is good, for one Ioyntenant may make a Leaſe to the other, although he cannot infeof, for a Leaſe is but a contract. And <hi>11 H. 6.33.</hi> one Ioyntenant commanded the other to occapy all, and in a treſpaſs he was compelled to plead this as a Leaſe, and then if one Ioyntenant does ſow all and dyes, the other ſhall have the Corne by Survivor: and it is not as in caſe where a man hath an eſtate deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable upon uncertainty, for there his Executors ſhall have the Corn, but in our caſe, the Survivor had contracted with his companion, and thereby had bound himſelf not to meddle with the land, and the other beſtowed great coſts in manuring and ſowing the Land, and therefore the Executors ſhall have the Corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner</hi> agreed, but doubted whether one Ioyntenant could make a Leaſe to the other: but ſaid, that by the contract he had excluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the proffits; and by the <hi>39 Ed. 3.27.</hi> one Ioyntenant may have an account againſt the other. And he ſaid, that if I agree that you ſhall ſow my Land with me, you ſhall gain no intereſt in the land, and yet you ſhall have the corne. And one Ioyntenant may diſtreyn for himſelf, and as Bayly for the other. And the Cauſe was adjourned: and afterwards <hi>viz. Hillary 36 Eliz.</hi> the caſe was repeated.</p>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57352:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>And <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſaid. That if there be two Ioyntenants, and one grants to the other that he may ſow the Land, yet may the other occupie with him, for theſe words do not transfer any ſole intereſt, but if he ſayes that he ſhall occupy all the Land, and ſhall ſow it ſolely, this does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from having any intereſt with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham.</hi> Agreed, becauſe this is but a contract, and ſo of a Leaſe for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> If one Ioyntenant ſayes to the other, that he will not occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie the Land with him, or that he will not put in his Cattle, this does not transfer any intereſt, but that he may occupie with him, and ſo in this caſe, if it had not been ſaid that he ſhould occupy ſolely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Popham</hi> of the ſame opinion: for where he ſayes he will not occupy, the words are in the negative, which will not exclude him of his intereſt, but in the Caſe at Bar they will, becauſe they are in the affirmative ſo. That he ſhall occupy the Land ſolely. And Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Johnſon for the Defendant.</hi> The term is gone, for he cannot occupy after the ſurrender, and alſo the Obligee is a party to the cauſe why it is not performed, and therefore he ſhall take no advantage,

               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> It cannot be a condition, becauſe the ſentence is imperfect; for if a man makes a Leaſe for life, rendring rent,
<hi>ſub hac conditione,</hi> that if the rent be behind, without any further words, this cannot be a condition, by reaſon of the imperfection of the ſentence; and without doubt, if a Leaſe for years be made to a woman, if ſhe ſo long live, and inhabit the premiſſes, this is a limitation, ſo that the term is ended by her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clench.</hi> It is neither condition nor limitation; for a condition ought alwayes to be a full and perfect ſentence, and not uncertain. As a Leaſe for years, upon condition that the Leſſee ſhall pay
<hi>181.</hi> at the houſe of the Leſſor, this is a full ſentence: but a Leaſe made, rendring rent, and if it be behind, (and no more ſaid) this is no condition. And in all caſes where theſe words, <hi>quod ſi,</hi> do make a condition, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57352:61"/>that theſe words,
<hi>quod tunc,</hi> do enſue. Neither can it be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, becauſe the words, <hi>quod ſi,</hi> ſpoyl the ſentence. And <hi>Popham</hi> was alſo of opinion, that it was neither condition nor limitation: but if the words had been <hi>ſub conditione quod tamdiu vixerit &amp; inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, &amp;c.</hi> this is a perfect ſentence, and by her death, or not inhabiting, the eſtate might be determined; and he put this difference, that if a Leaſe had been for <hi>20</hi> years, <hi>ſi tamdiu vixerit ſuper praemiſſos,</hi> the Leaſe had been determined by her death: but if a Leaſe had been for <hi>20</hi> years, <hi>ſi tamdiu inhabitaret, quamdiu vixerit, vel durante vita ſuper praemiſſos;</hi> there if ſhe dyes within the term, yet the term continues, for in the firſt caſe the limitation goes to the intereſt, and in the other to the time; and Iudgement was given, that the Plaintiff ſhould recover, for that the term continued.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Popham cont.</hi> But he agreed that the reſervation was voyd, for if no Land do paſs, no Rent is reſerved, and the reſervation only does not make any eſtoppell, and he took a difference upon the <hi>14 Ed. 4.</hi> A man makes a Leaſe generally, and the Leſſee is bound to pay the Rent in ſuch manner as it was reſerved, there ſuch Rent ought to be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, otherwiſe the Obligation is not forfeit, and the demand ought to be upon the Land; but if ſuch Leſſee for years do oblige himſelf to pay the Rent at a Collaterall place out of the land, there he ought to pay it at his perill without any demand, for now he payes it in another nature than as Rent; ſo here if the payment had been limited at a place out of the Land, the Obligor is bound to pay it, although nothing were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, for by the bond he hath made it a ſum in groſs. And it is altered from the nature of Rent upon the firſt reſervation, and he is bound alſo to pay the Rent or ſum, and if this be any of them, he muſt pay it: As to the ſecond point: he made this difference. <hi>A</hi> his bound to <hi>J.S.</hi> to Releaſe to him all his right which he hath in the Land deſcended to him, on the part of his Mother; there, in Debt upon this bond, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee cannot plead that he hath no right deſcended to him on the part of his mother, but muſt Releaſe at his perill. But if he binds himſelf to infeof the Obligee of all the Land which he hath by deſcent of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there he may plead that he hath no Land from his Father: for all may be Releaſed, although the Releaſor hath no right: but a feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be made of land which a man hath not.</p>

<hi>29 Ed. 3. Avowry 298.</hi> But a Guardian in ſocage cannot preſent to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon, becauſe he cannot be accountable.

               <p>
                  <hi>Gawdy</hi> and <hi>Fenner.</hi> This Diſtreſs is well taken for the arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the Statute of the <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 37.</hi> for the Rent doth not iſſue out of the term for years, but out of the Free-hold; and upon grant thereof, as <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, the Tenant of the Free-hold ought to attorn, and not the Termor; and ſo is it, <hi>9 H.

<hi>Cook, 4 Rep. 49.</hi> but an Avowry is given by this Statute, <hi>Onely ſo long as the land ſhall continue in the ſeiſin and poſſeſſion of the ſaid Tenant in demeſn</hi> And they much relyed on this word
<hi>(demeſn)</hi> which ought to be intended of a Free-hold; and of a Reverſion upon a Leaſe for years, it is pleaded, <hi>quod ſeiſitus in dominico ſuo, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo cannot a Tenant for years ſay; for which reaſons it ſeemed to them that the Diſtreſs was well taken.</p>

<hi>10 H. 6.</hi> for he hath taken the profits; and by the words of the Statute, they are <hi>(in the poſſeſſion or ſeiſin)</hi> and
<hi>ſeiſin</hi> refers to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Free-hold, and poſſeſſion to the Tenant for years; and the words are, <hi>(which ought immediatly to pay the Rent)</hi> and ſo ought the Termor in our Caſe, who is chargeable to the Diſtreſs of the Teſtator.</p>

                  <hi>Gawdy.</hi> Although the Cattel of the Leſſee be diſtreynable by the Teſtator, that is onely becauſe they are upon his land; as a ſtrangers Cattel may be ſo diſtreyned, and therefore this proves not that the Leſſee ſhould pay the Rent. And if a man grants a Rent-charge, and lets the land at will afterwards, the Rent is behind, and the Grantee dyes, and the Leaſe at will determines, without queſtion in that Caſe the Leſſor is ſubject to the Diſtreſs of the Executor. And in our Caſe, if the Grantee had releaſed to the Tenant for life, this had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht the Rent, otherwiſe of a Releaſe to Tenant for years.</p>

And to prove that the Free-hold doth paſs, he cited the Caſe of <hi>Littleton,</hi> where if a Leaſe be made to the husband and wife during Coverture, they are Ioynt-tenants for life. So in the

And it is clear, that a Tenant at will cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign over. And alſo an eſtate at will is an eſtate at the will of both parties: but here it is at the will of the Leſſor onely, when he will make a Bailiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haughton contr.</hi> An eſtate at will doth paſs, and not a Free-hold; for here he hath not pleaded that Livery was made; and Livery ſhall not be intended in this caſe, unleſs it be ſpecially alledged: but if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very had been made, then he agreed that a Free-hold conditional had paſt; and for the pleading of a Livery, he took a difference, that where an expreſs eſtate either in fee or for life be pleaded, there Livery ſhall be intended: but where a Free-hold paſſeth by implication or operation of Law, and not by expreſs words, there Livery ought to be pleaded, as a Leaſe to one for years, the remainder to another for life, there Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ought to be pleaded. So in the <hi>21 Aſſi.</hi> If a man pleads a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Livery within the view, he muſt plead Livery within the view expreſly; and ſo upon Grant of a reverſion, attornment ought to be pleaded.

                  <hi>PEter Carus</hi> was indicted for drawing his Sword in
<hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall,</hi> the Court then ſitting, in reſiſting the Sheriff who was making an Arreſt; and being found guilty upon his Arraignment, it did appear that this fact was done upon the ſtairs of the Court of requeſts, out of the view of the Courts; yet it was held, that being in the Hall, it was as much as if it had been in view of the Court. But becauſe the Indictment was not good, for it was not <hi>coram Regina.</hi> as it ought to be, the Iudgement was only to have perpetual Impriſonment, and to pay <hi>1000 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> Fine to the Queen.

               <p>IN a Treſpaſs, the Plaintiff declared that he was robbed of
<hi>20 <abbr>l.</abbr>

                  </hi> about him, which ſum the Defendant fook, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his own poſſeſſion. The Defendant confeſt the taking the

               <p>THis caſe was privately argued before the Lord Treaſurer, becauſe the parties agreed to refer themſelves to the opinion of
<hi>Wray</hi> and <hi>Anderſon.</hi> And the caſe was this, the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> deviſed by his will, his Iewells to his wife. And dyed poſſeſſed of a Collar of Eſſes, and of a Garter of gold and of a Buckle annexed to his bonnet, and alſo of many other buttons of gold and pretious ſtones annexed to his robes, and of many other chains, bracelets and rings of gold and pretious ſtones. The queſtion was if all theſe ſhould paſſe by the deviſe, under the name of Iewells. And both Iuſtices did Reſolve that the Garter and Collar of Eſſes did not paſs, becauſe they were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Iewells but enſignes of Honour and State, and that the Buckle in his bonnet, and the buttons did not paſs, becauſe they were annexed to<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57352:69"/>his Robes, and were therfore no Iewells. But for all the other chaines, rings, braceletts and Iewells, they paſſed by vertue of the ſaid Will.</p>

               <p>IN an ejectment, the Caſe was this. <hi>M. Sperke</hi> made a Leaſe of the land in queſtion to <hi>William Sperke</hi> for <hi>89.</hi> years if <hi>William</hi> ſhould ſo long live, the remainder after his death to the Executors or Aſſignes of the ſaid <hi>William</hi> for

Secondly, If the leaſe for <hi>40.</hi> years, be a Chattell veſted in the Inteſtate in his life, for if it be, then his Adminiſtrator ſhall have it. And as to the firſt. I conceive that ſhe is not aſſignee to take theſe <hi>40</hi> years. For in the <hi>19 Ed. 3.</hi> It is there ſaid that Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are not aſſignees, for adminiſtration is appointed by the ordinary and aſſignees muſt be in by the party himſelf and not by a ſtranger, and therefore an Adminiſtrator cannot be an aſſignee, as an Executor that comes in by the partie, or as a husband for his wife.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Iuſtices to the firſt point was, that the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator could not have it as aſſignee, and as to the ſecond point. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> ſaid, that it could not veſt: for if a man have a Leaſe for life, the remainder for <hi>40.</hi> years, the remainder is voyd, becauſe there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon named to whom it is limited: but if a man make a Leaſe for life, and after his death to his leſſee for <hi>21.</hi> years, that is good, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor ſhall have it as in right of his Teſtator. But where a man makes a Leaſe for years or life, the remainder after his death for <hi>40.</hi> years to his Executors, the Executors ſhall have it as purchaſors, for this word remainder divides it from the Teſtator, and makes the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors purchaſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley, Glanvill</hi> and <hi>Kingſmill cont.</hi> And their chief reaſon was from the intent of the parties, and their intent was that the Leſſee ſhould have an eſtate during life, for it is to him for <hi>89.</hi> years, if he ſo long live, and becauſe by common intendment he cannot ſurvive thoſe years, their intent was that his Executors ſhould have it after his death, and that the certainty of the time might be known it was limited for <hi>40.</hi> years.</p>
               <p>And <hi>W lmſley</hi> ſaid, that the Adminiſtrator could not have this by purchaſe, for when a man takes by purchaſe, he muſt be named by an apt name of purchaſe by which he may be known; as if there be tenant for life, the remainder to the right heirs males of <hi>J.S.</hi> and
<hi>J.S.</hi> hath iſſue two ſons, and the eldeſt hath iſſue a daughter, and <hi>J.S.</hi> dies, this daughter ſhall never take any eſtate, becauſe ſhe is not heir male, ſhe<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57352:70"/>hath no name of purchaſe; and therefore here the Adminiſtrator can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take by purchaſe, for the Adminiſtrator comes in by the ordinary, and therefore cannot be an aſſignee. And at laſt. Iudgment was given. That the Adminiſtrator ſhould hold it, as a thing veſted in the Inteſtate.</p>

<hi>31 Ed. 3.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57352:71"/>gainſay this, for the mother was denyed the Wardſhip, becauſe ſhe was attaint of Treaſon: for the Law will not ſuffer that the infant ſhall be in Ward to any, who may be ſuſpected to do wrong to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants land, or to his perſon, and therefore he ſhall not be in Ward to any that may inherit him, for there is a ſuſpicion that he may kill the infant. And <hi>5 Ed. 6.

               <p>IN an Ejectment upon a ſpecial Verdict, the Caſe was this;
<hi>John Burly</hi> ſeized in Fee of land, doth deviſe it to his wife for life, the remainder to <hi>William Burly</hi> in tail, the remainder to his next heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, being of his ſirname, in Fee, and dyes, and then his wife does intermarry with <hi>William Burly,</hi> who had the remainder in Tail, and then they levyed a Fine <hi>come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> to <hi>J.S.</hi> and by the ſame Fine <hi>J.S.</hi> rendred to the wife for life, the remainder to the husband in Fee, and then a common recovery was had againſt the husband and wife, and that was to the uſes contained in the Fine: then the wife dyes, and the husband dyes without iſſue, and the right heir male of the ſirname of the Deviſor enters, and makes a Leaſe to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, who being outed by the Leſſee of <hi>William Burly,</hi> brought the Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Williams.</hi> Here are two points; firſt, if this be a diſcontinuance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the wife; ſecondly, if the recovery barrs him in the remainder.<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57352:72"/>And as to the firſt point, when woman tenant for life, and he in the remainder in Tail being her husband, do joyn in a Fine, this ſhall not be a diſcontinuance of the eſtate Tail; for by <hi>Littleton,</hi> diſcontinuance cannot be by way of grant, although it be in caſe of a Fine, but ought to be by Livery. And as to the ſecond point, <hi>Knivetons Caſe, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 252.</hi> is expreſs in the point, that notwithſtanding the common recovery, yet the entry of him in the remainder is legal; for as to the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, a baſe Fee doth paſs to the Conuſee of the Fine, which is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred back again to the woman for life, and her husband in Fee; and by the Common Law there was no remedy for him in the reverſion againſt a recovery had againſt Tenant for life, <hi>7 H.
7.12. 5 Ed. 4.2.</hi> untill the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the
<hi>2.</hi> which gives to him a Writ of <hi>ad terminum qui praeteriit,</hi> and by the Statute of the <hi>23</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> he may enter: but now the queſtion is, whether this recovery will bar him in the remainder of his entry, becauſe the recovery was of another eſtate, and not againſt his Tenant for life. But I conceive that the wife is not in her former or antient eſtate, but takes hereby a new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; for if Tenant for life grants his eſtate to <hi>J.S.</hi> and his heirs, and <hi>J.S.</hi> grants a Rent, and then re-grants an eſtate to the Tenant for life, the Tenant for life ſhall be liable for the Rent, <hi>Dyer 252.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harris contr.</hi> For by the rendring of the eſtate by the Fine, ſhe ſhall be in her antient ſtate; and he cited the Caſe of
<hi>Peter Cary</hi> here adjudged, who being Tenant in T. the remainder to the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> was attainted, and then the King pardon'd him, and gave him his land again, and then he ſuffered a common recovery, and thereby barred the remainder in the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Anderſon</hi> was againſt this Caſe, and ſaid, that by the render the woman was in her antient eſtate, and ſo the remainder diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the entry of him in the remainder taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warburton.</hi> The Fine does make no diſcontinuance, for they give away but that which they may lawfully do; and ſo is <hi>Bredons Caſe, Cook, 1 Rep. 67.</hi> and as to the common recovery, it is out of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> becauſe ſhe remains party to the Fine; and by the render upon the Fine, they ſhall be as in by a new eſtate, and then the recompence ſhall not be to the antient eſtate, and therefore he in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is not barred nor impeached by this Fine, but he may enter within five years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kingſmill</hi> accorded; for it is plain, that by the render to the husband and wife, they are in a new eſtate, and the recompence ſhall go as to that, and not to the antient eſtate: but <hi>contr.</hi> if it had been by way of voucher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley</hi> accorded: but notwithſtanding the Fine, and recovery, the entry of him in the remainder is good; and as to the woman, it is clear, that there is no diſcontinuance to him in the remainder in Fee, for he in the remainder in Tail cannot diſcontinue, becauſe he is ſeized by force of the eſtate Tail; as the <hi>4 H. 7.17.</hi> Tenant in Dower, and he in the reverſion in Tail, joyn in a Fine, this is no diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the eſtate Tail, becauſe he was never ſeized, and therefore it is a forfeiture in the Tenant for life, although he in the remainder joyn'd with him, by the <hi>41 Ed. 3.</hi> but otherwiſe if Tenant for life, and he in remainder in Fee, joyn in a Fine. <hi>Vid. Bredons Caſe, 1 Rep. 76.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I conceive he in the remainder may enter, for all paſſeth from the Tenant for life, and it is her Feoffment, and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other, and ſo the eſtate Tail being ſpent, he in the remainder<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57352:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall enter for forfeiture, and the recovery ſhall be no bar, becauſe it was of another eſtate: and alſo this title of entry for forfeiture ſhall not be barr'd by the common recovery, no more than if a Feoffee upon condition does ſuffer a common recovery, yet may the Feoffor enter for the condition broken: and Iudgement was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: ſo that his remainder was neither diſcontinued by the Fine, nor his entry taken away by the Recovery.</p>

               <p>IN an Action on the Caſe for a Trover, and converſion of
<hi>40 <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> on not guilty pleaded, it was found for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> How can an Action lye for a Trover of money, if it be not within a bag? for this Writ ſuppoſeth a loſs; and when the money was loſt, how doth it appear that the money found is the ſame money that was loſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davies.</hi> There are many preſidents in the Kings Bench to prove that this Action will well lye for corn and money, and I have been of Counſel in many of thoſe Caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warburton.</hi> If the money were loſt in view of a third perſon, upon ſuch Trover the Action will lye, for there it may be proved that it was the money of the Plaintiff. And <hi>Walmeſley</hi> agreed. And note, that a preſident was ſhewn, <hi>tempore 40 &amp; 41 Eliz. inter Holloway</hi> and <hi>Higgs,</hi> which was thus; a maſter delivered to his ſervant <hi>30</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of corn to be ſold, and the ſervant ſold them, and converted the money, and the maſter brought his Action on the Caſe for the Trover and converſion againſt the ſervant, who pleaded, not guilty, and it was ſound againſt him; and two things were moved in arreſt of Iudgement; firſt, that the maſter was never poſſeſſed of the money, and therefore could not loſe it; ſecondly, becauſe the money cannot be known, and ſo <hi>non conſtat</hi> whether it was the money of the maſters, or no. But notwithſtanding this Caſe, Iudgement was given for the Plaintiff, becauſe the poſſeſſion of the ſervant was the poſſeſſion of the maſter; and when the ſervant converts this to his own uſe, by this the maſter loſeth the property, and is alſo a converſion in the ſervant.</p>

               <p>IN Debt againſt Sir <hi>Edward Stanhop,</hi> as Executor to

                  </hi> to his daughter within age, with power of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon the payment of <hi>20 <abbr>s.</abbr>
                  </hi> and it was found that this was done to defraud Creditors, and then he dyed poſſeſt of the goods, and the Defendant ſold theſe goods, which made him Executor in his own wrong, and afterwards takes Letters of Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walburton.</hi> I conceive the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgement, for the Statute of <hi>21 Eliz.</hi> of fraudulent conveyances, annuls this gift of the Inteſtate, becauſe he did it to defraud his Creditors, and then when he dyed it was aſſets in the hands of the Adminiſtrator. And if a Teſtator have goods wrongfully taken from him out of his poſſeſſion, theſe are not Aſſets to the Executors or Adminiſtrators: but if they be taken out of the poſſeſſion of the Adminiſtrators or Executors, they ſhall be Aſſets, for they may take them again: but for goods taken from the Teſtator, they have but an Action. But here the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator may take the goods which were given by the Inteſtate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud Creditors, for the gift was voyd, and therefore they ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Aſſets. And as to the Action, it is well brought; for when a man does adminiſter as Executor, and then takes Letters of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, it is at the election of the Plaintiff to ſue him as Executor or Adminiſtrator, <hi>9 Ed. 4.33. 21 H. 6.8. 2 Rich. 2.20. 18 Ed.

6. cap. 14.</hi> for buying of wheate-meale, and converting it into ſtarch. It was reſolved by three of the Iuſtices (<hi>Cook</hi> being againſt it) that this is not within the Statute: but they agreed, that if one bought corn and thereof made meale or oat-meale, and ſold it, that this was within the Statute, for that is uſuall, and is no alteration, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the ſame corn, but ſtarch is altered by a trade or ſcience, which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57352:74"/>is a myſterie, and ſo it is not the ſame thing that was ſold. But <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Iuſtice <hi>contra.</hi> And cited one
<hi>Franklinghams</hi> Caſs <hi>Michaelm. 39 &amp; 40 Eliza. in B. R.</hi> where one bought Barley, and becauſe it was of ſuch Quantity that he could not make Malt of it in his own houſe, he made Malt thereof in anothers houſe by his own ſervants. And it was reſolved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the converſion of corn into Malt, in his own houſe, with an intent to ſell it was within the Statute, unleſs there be a ſaving for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Foraſmuch as it was in anothers houſe, he is out of the <hi>proviſo,</hi> and ſo within the penalty of the Statute. And in
<hi>Paſch. 42 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Gerret.</hi> That if a Miller buyes corne, and grinds it and ſells it within his houſe, this is within the Statute.

                  <hi>Foſter</hi> Iuſtice took an exception, becauſe the information conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> whereas it ought to have been <hi>contra for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Statutorum.</hi> For this Statute was of force untill the <hi>8 Elizab.</hi> and then was determined untill the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <p>IN an action of Covenant the Plaintiff declared on a Leaſe made from the Deane, the Caſe was thus. The Deane in the <hi>38 Eliz.</hi> had made a Leaſe for <hi>99.</hi> years, to one <hi>Themilthorpe,</hi> and then in the <hi>42 Eliz.</hi> made a Leaſe to the Plaintiff for three lives, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, with a Letter of Attorney to make livery, and a Covenant to ſave the Plaintiff harmeleſſe againſt <hi>Themilthorpe,</hi> afterwards the Attorney makes livery <hi>ſc.</hi> after <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> which was a Rent day, and he being diſturbed by <hi>Themilthorpe,</hi> brought this Covenant. And two points were moved in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Inaſmuch as the Leaſe was voyd to <hi>Walter,</hi> whether that the Covenant was voyd alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the livery made after the Rent day be voyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoghton Serjeant,</hi> If the Covenant depended on the intereſt of the Leaſe, as a Covenant to repay the thing deviſed, or to pay rent, theſe had been voyd, becauſe the Leaſe it ſelf is voyd, for they do immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the Leaſe, but where the Covenant is for a thing colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall, as a Covenant that the Leſſor is owner at the time of the Leaſe, or that the Leſſee ſhall enjoy it, or ſhall be diſcharged and ſaved harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, theſe Covenants being collaterall to the Leaſe and intereſt are good, although the Leaſe be voyd, and the
<hi>43 Ed. 3.</hi> proves this: where a Leaſe was made by a <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Feme,</hi> a Covenant by them ſhall not binde the wife,
<hi>contra</hi> where the Covenant concernes the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as payment of Rent, &amp;c. Alſo the Covenant was broken imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon the ſealing of the Leaſe to the Plaintiff. And as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, he held it was a good livery, becauſe no time was limited in the Letter of Attorney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dodderidge Serjeant;</hi> The Covenant is voyd, becauſe the Leaſe is voyd, but <hi>contra,</hi> if it had been a Covenant to enjoy for three lives, and he relyed much on the difference between <hi>tempus annorum</hi> and <hi>terminum annorum</hi> in <hi>Cook 1. Rep. 124.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nichols cont.</hi> The Covenant is good, and yet in force, for when an eſtate is created in which is implyed a Covenant in Law, there if the eſtate be voyd, the Covenant is voyd alſo, but when there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Covenant in Deed, there it is otherwiſe, although the Leaſe be voyd or voydable, as if he Covenant that the Leſſee ſhall enjoy during the terme, and the leſſee reſign, yet is the Covenant good although the terme is gone. And as to the ſecond point. The livery is good, for untill the livery be made, the leſſor ſhall retaine his land, and no Rent is due.
<hi>vid. Commentat. 423.</hi> for by intendment the poſſeſſion is better than the Rent. And <hi>Cook</hi> agreed to this. And the Iuſtices agreed with <hi>Nicholls.</hi>

               <p>Note, <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> put this caſe. A man makes a Leaſe, rendring Rent at two Feaſts, and if the Rent be behind at any of the ſaid Feaſts or <hi>40.</hi> dayes after, and no diſtreſs to be found, that the Leſſor ſhall re-enter, the Leſſor comes upon the ground the laſt day of the <hi>40.</hi> and demands his Rent, and becauſe no diſtreſs was ſound on the land at the time of his demand, he entred. But it was averred that always before this day there was ſufficient diſtreſs, and the queſtion was, if his entry were good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſaid they had ſeen a Report of the ſame Eaſe. <hi>8 Eliz.</hi> That the diſtreſs ought to be on the Land on the laſt day, yea at the laſt inſtant of the day, which is a legall time to make a demand, or elſe the Leſſor may enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmſley.</hi> The ſame Eaſe was reſolved a year agoe in the Kings Bench between <hi>Ward</hi> and <hi>VVare.</hi> But if it were, (and no diſtreſs to be found at any time within forty dayes) there if there be a diſtreſs found at any time, it is ſufficient. <hi>Vid. 1.

               <p>IN a Replevin, the Eaſe was thus. <hi>Puttenham</hi> made a Leaſe of Land with a Stock of Sheep for <hi>20.</hi> years rendring Rent, and the Leſſee doth Covenant to render back to him at the expiration of the Leaſe <hi>1000</hi> Sheepe of the age of three or four years, and that the Leſſor grants all his Chattells, and this ſtock of Sheepe to
<hi>Elizabeth Vavafor</hi> the Defendants now wife: but in Truth, the Sheepe of the old ſtock were all ſpent, and others ſupplyed, part by increaſe, and part by buying of other Sheepe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> for the Defendant. The grant made by the Leſſor is good; for the generall propertie does remain in him, although that the Leſſee hath a ſpeciall propertie. To which it was anſwered, that if the ancient ſtock of Sheepe were ſtill, it had been godd; but it was not, and therefore the grant is voyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> Although the firſt ſtock was changed, yet the new ſtock does ſupply it, and is in place thereof, and ſhall be in the ſame condition as the other ſtock is, and therefore the Leſſor ſhall have propertie in it. But the whole Court was againſt him: for they ſaid, that the increaſe of the ſtock of Sheepe ſhould be to the Leſſee, and the Leſſor ſhall never have them at the end of the terme: but they agreed, that if the leaſe were of the ſtock with Lambs, Calves, and Piggs, there the increaſe belongs to the Leſſor. And all the Court took this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>ſc.</hi> when a leaſe is made of dead goods, and when of living; for when the leaſe is of dead goods, and any thing is added to them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations or otherwiſe, the Leſſor ſhall have this addition at the end of the terme, becauſe it belongs to the principle: but in caſe of a ſtock of Cattle, which hath an increaſe, as Calves and Lambs, there theſe things are ſevered from the principle, and Leſſor ſhall never have them, for then the Leſſor ſhall have the Rent, and the Leſſee ſhall have no profit.</p>

               <p>UPon a ſpeciall verduit, the Caſe was this. A man ſeiſed of land in ſoccage deviſed it to his yonger ſon, and died ſeiſed, the elder ſon enters and dies ſeiſed, and his heir enters, and the yonger ſon enters upon him, the Queſtion was, if his entry be taken away by this deſcent.</p>

                  <hi>VValmeſley.</hi> It is not, and he compar'd this caſe, to a title of entry for a condition broken, or a Conuſee of a Fine upon grant and render &amp;c. in which Caſes no deſcent ſhall take away entry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> The Deviſee hath intereſt preſently, and the land does not deſcend; for the deviſe prevents the deſcent, and the Freehold is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in the Deviſee, and the Statute <hi>32 H.

               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley.</hi> The Deviſee hath not a Freehold preſently, for if it were ſo, the Deviſee at the Common Law ought not to ſue an <hi>Ex gravi Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rela:</hi> but certainly if the freehold be in the Deviſee, his entry is taken away. And afterwards Iudgment was given by

               <p>But all the Iuſtices on the contrary; for when at the firſt day the Plaintiff did lend to the Defendant thirty pound that was abſolute, and the ſpeaking on the ſecond day cannot have ſuch reference to the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, that it ſhall be accounted all one.</p>

                  <hi>VVilliams.</hi> The King ſhall, for before the Statute the

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57352:79"/>The ſecond matter was, that no preſentment is pleaded againſt the King by the Patron, for it is pleaded that the Parſon was admitted and inſtituted, but not that he was inducted (but the Court held it good notwithſtanding that omiſſion) But as to the firſt point, the Court asked <hi>Williams,</hi> if he could ſhew preſidents that the King ſhould have ſuch preſentment, for they ſaid, that the uſage by the

<hi>Salisburie</hi> did Covenant, grant, condeſcend and agree with

And the firſt queſtion was, if this were a ſum in groſs, becauſe the Leſſee covenanted to pay this as a Rent. And reſolved by <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Iuſtice, and the Court, that this is a good reſervation of Rent, for it is by Indenture, and their intention was to have it as a Rent, and the words of the Indenture ſhall be accounted to be his, who may moſt properly ſpeak them. <hi>26 H. 8.2. 10 Eliz. 275. 22 H.

And after this <hi>John Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the heire did reverſe this recovery, by a Writ of Errour, and entred upon
<hi>Margaret,</hi> and ſhe brought her Writ of Dower, and was indowed of the third part, and then ſhe levyed a Fine of that third part to the ſaid

For at the Common Law, if a woman recover in Dower, ſhe hath waived that which was aſſigned to her in lien of her Dower, as in caſe of Dower
<hi>ad oſtium Eccleſiae,</hi> and <hi>10 Edw. 4.</hi> If the husband diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continues the Land of his wiſe, and ſhe brings a Writ of Dower, ſhe is concluded to have a <hi>Cui in vita.</hi>

But the Court held, that ſhe could not have her joynture, for by the recovery of the Dower her joynture is barred, for the Rent was given her in recompence of her Dower, ſo that it cannot be intended that ſhe ſhall have Rent &amp; Dower alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was adjudged that her entry on the Land was not good.</p>

<hi>Rape</hi> of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>John Aſhborn,</hi> was outlawed, during which, the Incumbent of the ſaid Church dyed, and the Earl preſented the ſaid <hi>Hudſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shut.</hi> I conceive this avoydance does not belong to the Earl, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this grant, for by the ſame Patent libertie is given to the ſaid Earl &amp; his heirs to put himſelf into poſſeſſion, and of ſuch things as he cannot put himſelf into poſſeſſion, they will not paſſe, and here this is a thing in action, which by theſe words will not paſſe. <hi>19 H. 6.42.</hi> by the grant, <hi>de Catalla Fellonum</hi> obligations do not paſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VValmeſley, Stanford</hi> in his prerogative, ſaith, that by the words, <hi>Bona &amp; catalla</hi> the King ſhall have the preſentation to the Church of him that is outlawed or Attaint, and by the ſame reaſon he may grant it by ſuch a name, and although the party cannot ſeiſe ſuch a thing, yet it ſhall paſſe <hi>39 H. 3.35.</hi> Rent for years ſhall paſſe by the grant of <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; Catalla.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Periam.</hi> It will paſſe by theſe words, for it is an ancient grant, for in that time the Patents, of the King were not ſo ſpecially penned, as now they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I conceive the avoydance will not paſſe by thſe words, for within this word <hi>bona</hi> moveables are contained both dead and living, and Avoydance is no Chattell nor right of Chattell.

And two points were reſolved. <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57352:85"/>

<hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, there was difference, where the Deviſe is, that Executors ſhould ſell his and the money divided between them, there if one die, the others ſhall not ſell, but otherwiſe here, becauſe the money is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his will.</p>
               <p>

Note that there were two verdicts in this caſe, and the firſt only found, that the Executors ſhoull ſell after the ten years, and that one dyed, and the other two did ſell within the ten years, and the opinion of the Court was that the ſale was voyd, but in the <hi>39</hi> and <hi>40 Eliz.</hi> all the whole will was found and Iudgment given <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
